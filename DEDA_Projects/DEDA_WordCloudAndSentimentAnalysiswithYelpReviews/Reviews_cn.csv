Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-10-10,"Authentic Northern Chinese cuisine ... even the atmosphere is authentic (ie more Neon than nostalgic ;) ) Chinese. Great food with pork as mainstay. Oh, and craft beers. Best to come with at least 3 diners to samples some variety (Chinese, not European dishes served here)."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2018-01-25,Went to DJL for dinner. Authentic Chinese food and service was pretty good too. Food was served fast.
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,2,2017-06-11,"If this is the best Chinese food that Berlin had to offer... wow... maybe someone should take a trip to China. 

Although the service was friendly and the menu seeming authentic with the inclusion of a few north eastern Chinese dishes, this is meals are aimed at the German palate, if your palate favors the toning down of flavors this place is for you. 

When it comes to looking for authentic tasting food, I'll steer clear of local reviewers thanks. Although I did have pretty tasty Chinese food in Frankfurt, so maybe it's just a Berliner thing."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-09-22,"Authentic cuisine, pretty good! We enjoyed the cucumber salad/ dumplings/ salt and pepper prawns/ bok choy w shiitake/ sour soup fish."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-02-09,"Relatively cheap and pretty authentic chinese restaurant. The servers are super nice and friendly so I want to give 5 stars for that.

Food was also pretty authentic although the choice was a bit limited. The duck was pretty good and crispy but yuxiangrousi ???? was a bit too sweet. The fried rice was ok. And the bokchoy and mushroom was good ????. Guobai ?? was great (i believe the place is ?? dongbei food. They also gave us free white rice! 

The food took a while to come out and the choice was somehow more limited than in the Bay area/california (i know this sounds weird since they have pages of food but they lack some super common authentic chinese dishes--- which to be fair not many people might order those here?) 

Otherwise, super good service, tasty food at decent price! Cannot ask for more for a chinese restaurant in Berlin!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-04-04,"Very good place for dinner, friendly servers, some dishes can serve up to two people. I recommend asking for the spring roll of entry - 2.80 euros. Recommend the dish with chicken fingers and vegetables - 9.90 euros."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-11-20,"Very authentic Chinese restaurant. Everything is well prepared and tasty, even the ""Westernized"" dishes.
Service is a bit quirky but friendly. Totally recommended"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-06-27,"This restaurant is a little out of the way but totally worth the trek. The food is very good and the service is wonderful. If you're unsure, the front part of the menu has photos of each item to help with your decision. If you want good Chinese food while in Berlin, Da Jia Le is worth a stop."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-06-12,"I've bookmarked this for the longest time, and finally, I got the chance to get here. Oh, how wonderful!

It's always a joy to find a Chinese restaurant that doesn't tailor its cuisine to the ""needs"" of the local population. Hence, when I was living in the US, I always sought these little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants because I didn't really dig General Tso's Chicken. And so here in Berlin, I am glad to have found this.

One tip: if you ever try and eat here, don't order from the menu that has no pictures. Order from the menu that has pictures. The picture-less menu is your standard Chinese fare that you would expect every Chinese restaurant would carry. But the menu with the pictures, those are the bomb!

We ordered three dishes which we shared between the two of us. We ordered the beef tripe (D03), the seaweed salad (D12), and the pork belly stewed in tomatoes with glass noodles (D33). All the dishes were amazing!

And surprisingly, they also have quite a good selection of German craft beers, which definitely work well with the hot dishes that they have!

I would definitely try to be back here when I can. But first I'll try to exercise and burn away this meal I ate."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-04-06,"I like the food here. You can choose between the western Chinese style or the transitional style. Both of them taste good for me. 

Das Essen schmeckt mir gut. Mann kann zwischen der westlichen chinesischen Art und der traditionellen chinesischen Art auswдhlen. Beide gefallen mir. Lecker. :)"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-07-16,"After living in Beijing for almost 4 years then moving to Berlin 2.5 years ago I've been craving REAL Chinese food and I'm very pleased to say I've found it! 

Authentic dishes,  superb flavours and very nice staff (they even kindly put up with my terrible out of practice Chinese!). Another delightful surprise was the great selection of craft beers on their menu BONUS! But I stayed faithful and had a Tsingtao to truly have my ? Chinese fix. 

Do yourself a favour and go eat some real Chinese food,  you will not regret it."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-02-13,"Well tickle me pink!  I had gone past this restaurant so many times and thought ummm meh because I have to admit it's not so welcoming looking from the outside. I also peered through the windows at night whilst passing in the car a couple of times and thought nah! Then I saw the reviews on yelp and thought seriously?

Having joined the yelp community and met some of the reviewers I thought...Yes seriously this must be good. So I took my little cold to try out something spicy.

Well we only ordered three dishes, I would have liked to have gone all Asian but I would have needed the stomach of a cow with it's four chambers to get through it all... on that subject you can indeed order stomach, trotters, tripe and the like should you so wish. We ordered Sichuan Style Tofu, Peking styled fried pork with pancakes and the Pork, shrimp, egg and vegetable dumplings. 

The dumplings were a good size and tasty. The tofu was firm and had a lovely spice to it, just right to unblock my nose! The pork wrapped in pancakes was delicious too. Portions are generous and we were really quite stuffed. Thankfully my friend knows me quite well and stopped me ordering by the third dish otherwise I would still be there eating now! I liked this place very much and will return to try other dishes. But my main mission will be to find people who have a stomach for the more adventurous side of the menu. Really want to try their intestines, hope it's like how my father used to make them. So many dishes to try! Just happy this place is so nearby and to think I have been searching for so long! 

Prices are a little on the steep side but I have to come to terms with that when it comes to Chinese food unless you get a greasy noodle box from some public transport station, but that is a whole different ball game!

Oh I should also mention they have an impressive selection of craft beers too!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-02-27,"The food was really good and the service was great! My favourites were duck with shrimps and for desert the caramelised sweetpotatoes!
Wonderful!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-03-30,"Probably some of the best Chinese I've had in Berlin... I can't say I've tried every place but everything I ordered was really fresh and tasty. The portions were actually quite large as well so you get your money's worth!

Also they have some local craft beer selections which is a plus!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-01-08,"Last time I tried the Sichuan-style chicken, which blew me away. I needed to give them one more star just for that dish.

I asked them about Hunan food in Berlin and they recommended another place not too far away which I tried, too."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2015-06-09,"I ate here last week and had a really delicious meal.  The restaurant is in a kind of odd location - just down from the Yorkstrasse station in an area of mostly apartment buildings and spдti.  It took us a second to figure out how to get inside the restaurant...turns out there are sliding doors on the right!  The interior is nothing special, just the typical Chinese restaurant stuff, but it was quiet and the booths felt intimate. 

The menu is quite large!  I had difficulty picking something out from all of the options.  Eventually we settled on a chicken and a pork dish (I don't remember the names because they were Chinese!) and some pork & shrimp dim sum.  Both of our dishes were awesome!  Especially the pork, which was cut into very thing strips like straws.  The dim sum was very good but it took a loooong time to come out; we had nearly finished our entrees before it was delivered. 

One cool thing about this place is that they serve craft beer!  I was impressed with the beer selection and, although I opted for a Rollberg on draft this time, was excited to see so many unique options. 

All in all, it was really nice and I would definitely go back!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-06-20,"This place is incredible! I live only 2 blocks away and just discovered the place! The waitress was super friendly and the food was exceptional! 
I never write reviews on Yelp, but This place was too good for me not to. 
If you want delicious authentic Chinese food with big portions, this is the place to GO!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-05-23,"Food: Authentic, delicious, and freshest ingredients. 
Drinks: Selected craft beers and top notch wines for an affordable price.
Service: Run by a sweet and friendly family.
Perfection!"
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-04-29,"Wow, this is a great chinese restaurant. Already when you enter the restaurant you somehow feel you are in China. The decor is a bit tacky and the place itself has a very large dining room with a lot of tables. The food is really great, I would rate it as the best Chinese food I had in Berlin. We went for the cold potato salad and the squid for starters, both excellent. For mains we had some steamed fish and fried sweet and sour pork. The dishes were just excellent and on top of all this great food this place also has a craft beer list that matches some fancy bars in Berlin. A full thumbs up in every aspect."
Da Jia Le,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-05-20,One thing for sure. Check their fish menu! Everything is the next-door-girl but their Fish is a diva.
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-09-22,"We've eaten Chinese in lots of place around the world and this ranks easily in the top 3. My wife had gong pao chicken and I had the fried black pepper beef; both were superb. Veggies sweet and crunchy, meat cooked to perfection. We also has an order of baked shrimp crackers--marvelous. 

And the service was attentive and efficient and very prompt. Perhaps prompted by reviews here, waiter told us tip was not included.

Highly recommended."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-08-04,"I give this place a solid 4 stars. I went to this spot during their lunch hours so I was able to order from their lunch menu. The prices were super reasonable with their lunch menu. Each person's meal ranged from 7 to 10 euros. 

I ordered their fried tofu. As far as my drink, I opted for their rose blossom tea. I recommend both of these options for lunch. In total I paid about 12 euros for my drink and lunch. The fried tofu is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce is kind of salty. Thus, I would have wanted more rice. I suggest you order an extra bowl of rice to counter the salty level of the tofu dish."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2016-09-30,"They don't actually stay open as late as they say. Hours aren't accurate. We arrived a half hour before the listed closing time, and we weren't allowed to be seated. Despite telling him that his hours posted on the door indicate the restaurant is open, we were turned away. Don't waste your time."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-09-11,"Wow! Good food and service- actually some of the best we found in Berlin. Vegetable options, English and German menus, high quality food. Highly recommend."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2017-02-28,I had such high hopes due to all the great reviews. And I got disappointed. Had a soso honey pork dish which really didn't flash me at all. The sugar peas where rather spare and overall the dish was pretty bland. Bummer!
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2017-08-24,"OK food, but terrible service! Wait forever to get my check. Be careful, they'll secretly add tips on your bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-05-14,"I only order one thing , but it's not good
There's Expensive meal but using cheaper material, the yuxiang shredded pork should with carrots but they are using bean sprouts which maybe cheaper and really minimum agaric I only can find three piece in the meal, does make this meal really not good, I don't think I will come back again"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-09-24,"Delicious Chinese in Berlin. We had the dim sum and jelly fish for starters, then the kung pao chicken and duck for our main courses and the green tea with toasted rice to drink. All of it was very good, though we'll order it spicier next time. Highly recommended!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-08-30,The ubiquity of Chinese restaurants in every town I've been to dulls the senses a little towards what's going to be eaten. This place woke up my taste buds with dishes that were traditional but still new to me. It helped that I visited with some Chinese friends who ordered without really looking at the menu. I won't attempt to make any recommendations but needless to say everything we are was top notch and at a reasonable price. Recommended.
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-01-23,"I was seated quickly and the meal was brought about 5 minutes after ordering.  Had the sweet and sour chicken.  It was served different than what I am used to, but I enjoyed it.  Price was around 12 euros. Berliner tap beer was cold and awesome.

The waiters did disappear for 45 minutes and I had trouble getting the bill."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-07-02,"This is a really good Chinese place in Berlin. We had a variety of dishes, and all of them were very good. I'm 1/2 Chinese. The Peking Duck was actually quite authentic, contrary to some reviews, and the Bok Choy, Hong Shao Qie Zi (?????soy sauce braised eggplant), and Kung Pao Chicken were all fantastic. The service was good as well. They have English menus upon request. Free shot of plum wine at the end of the meal was nice. I'd definitely come back here."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2015-07-03,"The food here is good, and they have a special menu for the hot summer, but the service is strange, and I feel bewildered and neglected. Maybe I'm too accustomed to dining in the US, I just wished when I sat down, someone could come over and ask me what I'd like to drink. But the waiter just left me with a menu and left. It took some time and work to get their attention when I wanted to order. 

Moreover, tips are included in the total amount on my bill, which my German friend told me is unusual and never heard of in Germany."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2014-09-29,"Tried this place last night because of briefly reading a few reviews and I was not impressed. Being on Chinese decent living in Vancouver Canada where we been told we have the best Chinese food outside of China. This place was a disappointment and I hate to say the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We had a few starters soup, dumplings, fried noodles etc. which was different I was jot impressed. Waiting for our main coarse Peking duck to arrive I was hopeful and excited by saying they can't mess this up unless they change the sauce... They did instead of the classic housin sauce I Dunno what they gave us but left a chalky aftertaste. Bill came to 76 Euros!

Maybe my standards are high being from where I'm from but sorry this place is terrible. Don't say you haven't been warned."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2013-06-05,"One of the best Chinese joints I've been to in Europe.

Dirt cheap and the food is great. The menu is authentic and bountiful including very good dim sum, szechuan specialties and of course Peking duck with pancakes.

The duck was fairly moist and crispy. Everything else was fantastic. The eggplant in chili oil and garlic with cilantro was dreamy.

I wanted to order the entire menu and actually look forward to going back next time I'm in Berlin!!

Unfortunately, the service sucked, otherwise it would have deserved 5 stars!"
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-02-14,"It's one of those places made me wish there were more stars on Yelp reviews. Looks like a regular chinese place, but it's a gem. We tried lamb (don't know name showed picture in Yelp to order), duck with peanut souce, seaweed salad and dumplings. All excellent. Haven't eaten that good chinese in ages. Staff is nice and place is big and spacious too. They suggested wine with our food (no kidding), and I was surprised how it complimented food.

PS to bad mouthing chinese: Yeah you can eat better chinese in China. Too bad it's a trillion hour flight."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-09-28,"this is probably the worst restaurant i've ever been to, anywhere in the world. this includes the taco bell that consistently made me sick as a kid....

i've been in europe for almost 3 weeks now and was craving some chinese food, so found this place on yelp with 4 stars and 150 reviews, so figured it was a solid pick. we get there and are seated instantly (although we didnt have reservations, b/c they asked lol). it took a few minutes for our waitress but got drinks and food on order and waited. 

first up, XLB, because i have to eat XLB anywhere it is served (who doesn't?!). XLB was good but not soupy, but hey, it's germany, not shanghai or NYC. 

our entrees arrived and it's a bit weird. i ordered ""crispy fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce."" what i got was a fillet of fried chicken cut up, and then on top of it, another fillet of sesame encrusted chicken, also cut up. ok, that's cool i guess. then i get a bowl of sweet and sour sauce. 

this whole time, there's some fruit flies around, but when i pour out soy sauce (luckily on my plate b/c i wasn't sure if it was vinegar) there were *several* dead flies in it! holy smokes! my parents are with me and now aghast. the waitress that i told was like ""oh, yeah, ok ill get you a new one."" seems this is a known issue...

my dad got crispy duck and noted that it wasn't good, like it had been reheated. after leaving and reading additional reviews it seems we're not alone in that thinking. 

we got our check and left, but noted they added service on the bill of around 8%. i spend quite a bit of time in europe and i've only seen that at high end places, not places like this. no one on the team ever asked how the meal was or seemed concerned we barely ate anything. quite a horrible experience."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-07-13,"Extremely unfriendly waiters. We sat down on the terrace and they tried to move us to another table because they didn't want to walk the extra couple of meters to serve us. When we said we prefer to stay at that table they said we need to move because of our pram with our one month old daughter (sleeping by the way, so no annoying crying etc) was in the way. We just left."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-03-29,"Food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy, bland, and came out cold. Also, their staff were some of the rudest servers I've ever encountered. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-11-07,"Food was extremely salty. I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but I had to send my mapo tofu back. I could not eat more than a spoonful. When I told the server I wanted to cancel my order (not replace it) he reacted with a confused frowning face saying 'I tasted it, it's not salty. It's normal '. At least when I reiterated that it was in fact salty and I didn't want it he took it away and I wasn't charged for it. I was however shocked to see that they had added a tip to our bill (around 10% if I remember right). I have not seen this so far anywhere else in my two weeks here in Berlin. This includes more upscale establishments and restaurants serving us as a party of 10 or more (we were only 4 at peking ente).

As I side note, I understand that bottled water is part of the culture in Europe. But stating explicitly that you don't serve tap water and making the food this salty seems a big suspect."
Peking Ente,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2013-12-19,"5 stars??!!  Really?!  This place is overpriced and sub par.  
While visiting berlin we relied in this restaurant's stellar yelp reviews to make a dinner choice. If this is the best that Berlin has to offer, I suggest replacing all meals with bread and beer. We specifically ordered the specialties of the house in order to get the most authentic experience possible. The meal was just the opposite.  The soup and dumplings were good but nothing to write home about. The perch was over salty and totally overpowered by it's heavy brown sauce, the sweet and sour chicken was lightly breaded but the sauce was equivalent any US takeout, ditto for the roast At 32 euros The Peking duck was a rip off so we didn't even bother. The interior was a little better than average but the neighborhood and building looked like the ghetto."
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2014-09-04,"One of my favourite retaurants in Berlin. It's not shabby, not pricey and so authentic that the waiter is speaking Chinese with me. (Sadly I can't reply in Chinese) 

I often come here for the chicken feet. (Leave me alone I love them ok?) Beside that they have great lunch deals which go from 12:00 - 16:00 and cost about 6-7А. I can highly recommend the fried rice or the noodlepots. Latter are HUGE and so so good. You get a tablet with a bowl of broth, a bowl with rice noodles and several small plates with toppings suchs as mushrooms, seaweed or walnuts. I usually have the vegetarian one with a lot of veggies but the ones with meat looked pretty good as well.
This place is compared to other chinese restaurants like ""Good Friends"" (which is close by) more quiet and elegant. The interior looks high class- almost posh and the restaurant owner is super nice. I think that's a place where you can drop by with your parents are some special date.

All in all a great place!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-11-06,"So far I tried only ""Crossing the bridge"" soups, but they are outstanding. You get a huge bowl of broth, another bowl with crazy amounts of rice noodles and a set of ingredients you can add , they differ depending on the type of soup. It's definitely not the cheapest but worth the price. I would just prefer it to have a little less noodles and more extra ingredients like meat slices or nuts. But I am still very happy with this place. Exceptionally good for a hangover!"
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2017-01-27,"It's a basic family restaurant style. We visit for first time and expected at least fresh vegetables and healthy food. Taste was just soso, however sprouts and peanuts turned already bad. We will not come back."
Do De Li,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-10-22,"One of the best asian restaurants in Berlin (seriously) . The soups are between 6 to 10 Euro and are so huge (even by american standards) that it's usually a good idea to split the soup with someone else, which they will happily let you do. You might even consider ordering the aubergine and pork dish which is another standout. Also have more exotic stuff like pig feet which aren't bad."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-06-11,"This is difficult for me to admit, but yes-I am a closet yelper. I have rarely been satisfied enough by my meal to consider cracking open the door of repression and sharing my experiences with others, and lesser times yet without the influence of alcohol, but the meal I enjoyed at this restaurant tonight is worth sober-waving a rainbow colored (or whatever series of colors yelp lurkers are represented by) flag for. 

I am a cheap person and was delighted to find reasonably priced food. You can expect to pay about 10 euros per person if you only order entrees. My wife and I consumed our meal family buffet style, which this restaurant is really made for.

If you're timid and may be concerned about ordering authentic Chinese, there is no need to be here. The menu is spelled out in a few languages, including English, and every dish also has its picture next to it. Better yet, the food that comes out actually looks like the picture! They have the typical Chinese dishes (i.e.  sweet and sour chicken) for you to fall back on if cat tongue or whatever (they don't actually serve cat tongue... On the menu anyways. If they did I would consider getting it because everything looks delicious) doesn't quite do it for your palette. 

We had the sweet and sour chicken as well as the double fried pork, both of which were great. It was nice to be able to flip back and forth between a sweet and a savory dish. Most items like our chicken or pork also come with white rice. There are other options in back of the menu (noodles, fried rice) that are served as a stand alone dish. 

The service was quick, something I haven't experienced in Europe yet either. They have a more secluded section then another section that houses a ~60 inch TV. They adjusted the volume according to our preference and we watched Mulan a couple of times. Just kidding, it was some soccer match. 

Although I didn't receive a fortune cookie to tell me that sunshine is a ray of hope or that new friends are just around the corner, I was impressed enough to creep out of the bowels of my dark hole, break the silence, share my feelings, cover myself with feathers, lead the parade, and wave the flag for Lao Xiang."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-09-22,We enjoyed the cold wood ear salad/ fish congee/ pork buns/ cumin lamb. Cool atmosphere
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2017-06-28,"3* is for the nice staff.  Food really is disappointing.  Not quality ingredients & uses cheap substitutes.  Dishes came out different than in the menu pictures.  We have a Chinese speaking Chinese talking to the waitress & hoping the food we ordered will be ""for Chinese"".  Disappointed it came out still ""European"" Chinese food.  Using the wrong ingredients just didn't bring the right tastes.  

Staff is nice, presentation of the food is nice.  But I wish it had more good taste than looks."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-02-14,"Do try the double fried pork, it's slightly spicy and amazing. Its not like anything you've tried before!
Of course if you feel like eating chicken or frog legs, oyster or octopus Lao Xiang is the place for all of them.
The place is quite big, has even a private golden room and the service is nice."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-12-29,"to be honest, Chinese food is not my most favourite cuisine but I simply love this restaurant. I fell in love with their visually magnificent menu cards. and the food is terrific. I'm so lucky it's right next to the corner of my flat that I could come as much as I want."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-11-23,Great authentic Chinese food. Also try the hotpot which is actually not on the menu. Random funny note: The Xi'an warrior near to the bathroom is holding a Germany flag - not sure why.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-03-22,"I love this place, definitely he most authentic Chinese in Berlin. Have the feuertopf which is not on the menu (ask for it), it is great for a few friends and great value. The dumplings are some of the best I have tried. Menu might seem expensive bit courses are about sharing then having on your own."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-11-03,Really good Chinese hot pot!! Other things on the menu looked good too but were a bit pricy. Awesome place to eat at on a cold day and they have wifi!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2013-08-18,"Truly authentic Chinese food, with Hunan focus. Very reasonably priced and nice atmosphere.
 In summertime also relaxed seating outside."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2014-01-05,We had a great experience in this place located next to the train station in Prenzlauer Berg. The prices are quite inexpensive. Service is very attentive and dedicated. Portions are quite big. Food is quite tasty and the menu is quiet big. Maybe not the most authentic Chinese food that you can find but certainly a good value for your buck.
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-24,"Well, I don't know what authentic Chinese food is, because I've never been to China, but this was really fantastic. We ordered two main courses, which turned out to be A LOT of food, and I think it's common for people to share a main course and get a starter. But I am so happy to have a really good restaurant in the neighborhood finally.
I want to try most of the things on the menu, and some of them are a bit scary for Western palates (chicken feet and frog meat included) but in the end we just had a beef stew and a lamb thing that we finished.
I look forward to eating there many more times in the future."
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-11,Actually address is Wichartstrasse 43. Fantastic family-run Chinese restaurant from south China. Excellent authentic food reasonably priced. One of my really regular places. I am eating thru the ENTIRE menu!!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2013-08-14,Mit dem Lao Xiang hat sich endlich ein authentisches Chinarestaurant in den Pberg gewagt und ich hoffe es wird belohnt. Sehr leckeres Essen jenseits von Ente Sья-Sauer oder Hьhnchen mit Reis. Wir hatten als Vorpeise die Jiaozi (mit Schwein gefьllte Teigtaschen) und als Hauptgerichte das doppelt gebackene Schweinefleisch und den Tofu mit Schweine- und Rindfleisch. Alles war sehr lecker und in anstдndigen Portionen! Hungrig geht hier also niemand raus :-) Preis-Leistungs-Verhдltnis ist auch sehr in Ordnung inkl. netter Bedienung. Den einen Punkt Abzug gibt es nur fьr das etwas kalte und minimalistische Ambiente im Restaurant. Alles in allem: absolute Empfehlung!!
Lao Xiang,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2013-12-25,"Searching for a new restaurant for tonight, we found this one and tried it the first time. Interior is modern and nice. The menu offers lots of authentic dishes and the photos shown are quite close to what you get. The choice of dishes is a bit wider than other chinese restaurants, most of them being hunan style. We tried a lot and it was very good compared to other chinese restaurants in Berlin. The spicy cucumber has a great unique taste, and all dishes came in their original hot and spicy taste. They even had very yummy durian fruit desserts. Service was very friendly and fast, just the boss hasn't been so friendly, but just showed up once. So with really nice food and service, also reasonable price, we enjoyed the evening a lot. This one is in the top league for Berlin. Now we tried it some more times and enjoyed the same nice experience. We will come back to try more Definitely worth a try for all who are missing chinese/sichuan/hunan food here and are too lazy to cook at home."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-05-07,"We took many of the small dishes and they where all delishious, best was the seaweed, the different dumplings and the cold pork with chilli.

Best dinner in a while and it was cheap too."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-07-19,Very nice place with great food. I said I wanna spicy so the waiter asked for extra spicy for me. Very thoughtful. If you are looking for a place that down to earth but has very good food. This is the best choice around the neighbourhood.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-08-02,"This is the most authentic Chinese restaurant we've found in Germany. ?????????????????309 sichuan style chilli chicken is just so good, crispy and tasty. And the place is very easy to find. With nice decorations and light."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-12-29,"It indeed is a place that you can take a look if you really want some Chinese food in Berlin.

But the service here is extremely bad. A fat short-hair ~30-year-old male waiter here is a living definition of how bad the service can be provided. He ignored requests of customers and he was lazy and bad-tempered. He looks like a king in the restaurant but he is actually a pig: he only smiled at young ladies and frowns at male customers.

I wouldn't come back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2017-02-16,Very authentic Chinese Resturant. Try 309 (Sichuan-style Chilli Chicken).
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2017-07-01,"Below average service quality, food is ok. The waiter was rude; we were always ignored thus decided not to tip generously, he gave us the eye and complained rudely."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-01-18,"I've been to a number of Chinese restaurants in Berlin but this one is a real deal. I was so happy to find an authentic, yummy Sichuan Chinese place in this city. I read some people had problems with a rude male server there. My server was a female and she was friendly. Please don't get discouraged by a potential rude server. The food is worth a visit."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-01-24,"The best seafood soup I've ever had. Simple, yet so perfect. I don't remember the actual name but you can't miss it. The Shrimp is delicious! Really authentic. Definitely going back in a few days."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-12-29,"Honestly rating one star is overrating for tian-fu restaurant. Food, environment is ""ok"" in this place but overall not as good as the reviews. HOWEVER the service attitude towards to customers is ill-mannered especially the middle-aged waiter. The wait time was more than 30 minutes and this rude waiter said its normal to wait such a long time for dinning like its the customers problem.
I also noticed that other customers came in without reservation were treated inpatient.
I would not consider to have Asian food in this place any more."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-05-11,Who knew I would find one of my favorite Chinese restaurants ever in Berlin. And I don't even like Chinese food. Have spent a lot of time in China as well. Thanks guys.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2015-03-05,"I went here with some friends who highly recommended this restaurant. It is pretty authentic in Chinese cuisine but I didn't particularly love it. We ordered a bunch of dumplings and dim sum items. They were all pretty good, just not amazing in my opinion. I would try it again but definitely try some others out first before I go back."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-07-12,"great chinese restaurant! With quite a nice selection of meals, not only the classic ones!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-01-25,"Word of the day is BANGING BUFFET. This place got a pretty good buffet if you ask me, take my word or dont you foolios. The staff and waiters are deaf and blind so dont expect anything from them. Its all about the food. Xie xie means thanks you in chinese so dont forget to use that one, it all ways works. Trust me. Peace"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-03-24,"As far as I know this is the only good Chinese restaurant in Berlin, and it's actually as good as anything I""ve had back in San Francisco, New York, or Houston.

Once Berlin gets a decent cal-mex or tex-mex restaurant I'll never have to leave the city again for good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-10-22,Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin..  Try the spicy chicken (#309).  It's borderline too hot for me but the taste on the chicken and veggies is amazing.  We eat from here a couple times per month.  May need reservations for evenings.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-01-28,"By far the best restaurant for Sichuan food in Berlin! Couldn't find anything like this outside of China ;-)
Top!"
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-11-28,"It gets five stars for being the most authentic northern Chinese cuisine I've had in Berlin (I used to live in Beijing); malheureusement the prices reflect that.

Do you want ?????, ????,  ????????, ??.... ?? It's all here and it's all very, very tasty, ????, you won't regret it."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-02-11,Excellent chinese food! I can absolutely recommend this restaurant! Service is not too friendly but still polite. Unfortunately this restaurant does not accept credit cards.
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2011-06-27,"I quite enjoyed this restaurant.  Unlike a few others in the street (on a Saturday afternoon), this one actually had clientele. 

I indulged in a number of vegetarian options - dim sum, aubergine, mixed veg, and a water spinach dish.  All good - the aubergine being the highlight.  

Friendly service, quiet, and good food."
Tian Fu,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2011-05-24,"If you order a main course marked with 3 chilis in Tian-Fu, it really is uncompromisingly hot. Authentic Schezuan food, I must say.


 However, consistency seems to be an issue. Also the service of the male waiter was lacking."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-12-13,"Delicious Chinese food from Sichuan and Canton. The different kinds of Dim Sum variations are awesome.

This is place to be if you like to enjoy Dim Sum."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2018-01-06,"They made the best hot and sour soup of my life. Nice casual and elegant setting. Service is quick, if not brusk. They could improve upon the friendliness. They seem well equipped for large groups. I saw many tables were already reserved. The red curry was good but not great."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-10-24,"When you visit an Asian restaurant and you are the only non Asians eating...you know you are eating at the right place. Great atmosphere, good location and amazing food. We had the dinner for two and it was extremely filling... could have been for three or four light eaters. We left a lot of food. If your looking for not Chinese not Thai not Japanese... but something like it... this Asian hits the spot!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-11-07,"We had a lovely dinner at Restaurant Jolly! 
The interior was like a fine dining restaurant.
It was kind of funny how they had candlelit dinner tables with a romantic setting and people were chowing down with their chopsticks and rice bowls haha.
We came here as they are famous for their peking duck. It was really good! 
We were starved after a full day of touring around Berlin and finished the day off dining here. 
Service was excellent.

I'd recommend the:
* Sweet & sour soup
* Peking duck
* Stir-fry veggies

Also, a note to travellers.. they have free wifi! :D"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-10-19,"I joked that this is the place in Berlin where all the veggies go. People crow about the duck here, but the veg red curry and clay pot were both amazing. Full of a wide variety of veggies, really fantastic flavors, silky tofu. Never thought I'd love Thai curry at a Chinese place but the red curry was excellent. Bay Area, CA born and raised so I'm used to both cuisines, in their restaurant form. Spice level is decent if slightly dumbed down for the northern EU taste. This was the only place we ate in a Berlin that I could see myself returning to regularly. Really quite lovely. Oh. And FAST."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-11-10,"I was in Berlin in early October. My niece and I toured the Museum Island. We found Jolly nearby, with pretty good reviews, so we decided to have lunch here. We ordered crisp duck, small steamed dumplings, spicy lamb and mushroom/vegetables. What a surprise! Every dish was delicious! My niece studied in Germany for years and now works in Hamburg. She said this was her one of her most favorable Chinese meals. We at Chinese and I am from NYC area. That tells you how good the food was! We highly recommend this restaurant!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-02-13,"I went tonight with a group of 10... (We where here for the Berlin film festival. )  .. Amazing food. We had Duck, eggplant, more duck, Beef with veggies, fish with veggies, Duck, rice,  Dumplings, chicken... The best tasting Chinese food.. We loved it.... Best spot in Berlin... A+  A  recommend.. Get the duck lol... (Tea, the sesame balls, wine, etc... I will be back."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-09-03,"Good Asian food for Berlin, good Asian food period. German food is sorely lacking in spices and after a week of wursts and potatoes, s schezuan  kick to the  stomach was very welcome. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Dim sum even, not half bad."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,2,2017-07-22,"As an Chinese American, this restaurant seemed to have treated me like some disowned family member. Almost no attention was given to me.  I was given a small corner table while the German/white customers got the roomy tables - even for 2
Person groups. 

The hot and sour soup has a TOMATO base!  Definitely not authentic.  

The Jolly tofu pot was passable.  Interestingly used spam.  No shrimp. 

On the positive side, the tables and chairs and whole ambiance was good.  Just that they have some sort of reverse discrimination.  

If you r Asian, u know what to expect. Not fully authentic Chinese food and possible poor treatment."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-21,"Really delicious food. Big portions. Great atmosphere. Overall, would certainly recommend."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-18,"A really good choice for Asian food in Berlin. 
The food is very tasteful and staff is super nice and helpful. The dishes are enormous. We were 4 people  and didn't manage to finish more than half of the food, so a tip would be to perhaps start with one dish to share (if couple) - then add another one if still hungry.. Or have starters before sharing."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-03-06,A good variety of Asian regional food grouping. All items on the menu where good portions and rich on flavors. Still an authentic place that keeps some traditions in place. Certainly a place to repeat!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-04-05,I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:30 and the place was not packed at all. Amazing value and great atmosphere. I ordered the lunch special with duck and noodles for around 8 euro. It was delicious!
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-07-07,"This restaurant is a must-try! I have never before had authentic Chinese food outside of China - until I went to Jolly! 
A little expensive but great food. 

I had dinner here with my boyfriend to celebrate an anniversary. We met in China, so we decided to have Chinese food. We ordered the roasted duck with prawns and vegetables, beef with black pepper and silk tofu. All dishes were great! I would probably order duck without prawns next time though since they didn't taste much, or try the Peking duck!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-12-31,"We (2ppl) ordered the set menu for two, a bottle of water, two large beers and a small beer all together at 43 А. the set was as a whole very delicious and highly recommended. the servings and the pacing between dishes was good. I usually eat a lot and was skeptical there would be enough food to fill my appetite--there was, and with leftovers! The ambient is calm and stylish. 

The set included:
-sweet and sour soup
-4 egg rolls
-the main dishes (breaded duck and beef stir fried) served on the same platter and with a large bowl of rice
-vanilla ice cream with deep-fried bananas"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-13,"Solid Chinese food. All that's missing are some more pork dishes, such as some crispy belly ;)

Their Peking Duck is the thing to go for, but everything else I tried over a few visits were all good. For Chinese in Berlin, very good even. 

Efficient service too and nice to be able to look into the kitchen."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2015-10-02,"I would have never imagined that I would I'd end up having Chinese food in Berlin!  In any case, after a long day of touring Museuminsel on a chilly spring day, this was the closest restaurant to the island we could find, so we figured to give it a try. It ended up being a good decision!

Being Chinese, I think I can validate the authenticity of its food. We especially loved the dim sum choices that were offered as part of the menu. After weeks of traveling in Europe, this was my first taste of home! For less than А30, we had quite a feast for two!

The restaurant was surprisingly crowded on a weekday night. There was a mix of tourists and German business people. I'm taking a star off for its ridiculously slow service and lack of menus. The table next to us waited literally 20 minutes to get a menu! And we waited just about the same time to put down our order. The friendliness of the waiters and manager made up for the slow service in the end, though."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-12-29,"Possibly one the best... neigh, thee greatest Asian food I've had in Europe, would honestly consider a trip back to Berlin just to eat here. The sweet and sour duck with lychee was amazing, along with the duck curry, and fried noodle with chicken, top tier. Duck game strong tho. Would recommend again and again."
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-04-10,"Amazing crispy duck and dim sum. My partners soup was good as well. Nice ambiance and friendly service. The duck was enormous, easily enough for two with appetizers. Two drinks, two apps and a main course came to 32 euro. Well worth it!!"
Jolly,Pan Asian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-06-20,"Great food and nice place, staff looked very bored though."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-12-31,"For Chinese Food in Berlin on New Years Eve, without reservations, this was a solid choice.  Service was fast, the menu was extensive, and the dishes I ordered were perfect.  It's a large ""hall"" style Chinese restaurant, with a lot of tables, and a few smaller seating areas built inside, but it wasn't too noisy, and didn't feel cramped at all.

I'd definitely go back if I wanted Chinese food and were in Mitte."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-08-04,"I am not really a Chinese enthusiast, but the food, service, and location is good. I ordered the mini vegetable egg rolls, fried noodles with chicken, fried noodles with beef, chicken, and another meat that I can't remember, and fried rice.  I would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-06-04,"The most authentic Chinese restaurant I found so far in Berlin, should not be missed for ones looking for real Chinese foods but western Asian."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-05-19,"As a suggestion from one of my co-workers in Berlin, I ate here with my boss during a business trip to Berlin for dinner.  What a great choice!

The service was fast, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was okay.  Plus it was in walking distance from the Courtyard Marriott where we were staying.

Another place on my list when staying in Berlin."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2015-03-27,"Lots of options but the quality isn't that great. The staff is helpful. I do like the ambience. Spacious. I got the fried noodles with chicken, beef and vegetables. It was a bit too oily and not all that flavourful. For what you pay you can get better portions elsewhere."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-03-15,Too much MSG and the green peppers tasted moldy. might have been my taste buds so I give three stars. overall quite generic.
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2014-06-15,"Avoid at all costs if you don't to be treated as an intrusion rather than paying customer. I usually trust Yelp reviews because I know the reviewers care about great food as much as I do but this time I totally disagree with previous reviewers.

We chose this restaurant due to its closeness to our hotel rather than one with better reviews a distance away.  From the minute we entered I have never encountered such disdain, rudeness and lack of interest on behalf of the restaurant staff.  After 10 minutes after seating we still had not been greeted at table even though only 3 tables filled in restaurant.  Eventually got attention of waiter and the evening went down after.  His attitude was downright hostile - could it have been because we spoke English and not German? We were  a diverse group with Malaysia, Indonesia, Indian and US represented out to have a nice business dinner.

Now the food- pan fried dumplings okay, soups poor. Mains- crispy duck in Szechuan sauce & prawns in paprika-pepper both 3.5 stars.  Fried fish filet with mushrooms - no flavor & no fish!  Sweet & sour pork - 2 stars.

Decor- dated tacky Chinese decor with abundance of dirty/dusty fake flowers everywhere.

All in all- would have give 3 star but cannot tolerate or accept such rude and indifferent wait staff."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-01-24,Very good Chinese restaurant! Cook very fast and delicious! There is always a lot of visitors ... Very often it eat and enjoy!
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-02-03,"Best Chinese I know. Always delicious and friendly. Very reasonably priced as well.
Lunch menue is unbeatable in quality and price! Tastebuds what'ya say ?
YUMMIE"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-07-26,"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Food is great, spicy but acceptable because of the quality and the freshness of the food. Lots of Chinese restaurant is using glutamates to cover and give the impression of Chinese food. Here none, it's just well prepared with delicious and fresh vegetables. We loved it really!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2015-06-08,"Really good Chinese food! Had spicy chicken with pineapple, carrots and peppers. It was really solid. Nice interior, very clean and modern, white tablecloth kinda place. Very nice service and a menu in English. Much appreciated!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-10-01,"Been here twice. Great Chinese food! The chicken was tender and fresh and the veggies were perfect. Friendly, fast service as well. Nice quiet neighborhood to walk around in as well. Will definitely come back for the dim sum which looked delicious."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2014-09-11,"Not bad, it's exactly Chinese style. The boss is from Zhejiang, the soup is good, home style."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2011-10-18,"Great authentic Chinese food at reasonable price. The location is great although it might have been a little cosier if the lighting would have been a little bit darker.
I tried a very spicy chicken, believing it would be Sichuan spicy. This was not the case. The chicken was great but not as spicy as expected.
I would easily recommend this place!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2011-01-29,At the moment this is one of my favourite chinese restaurant in Berlin. The food is delicious!
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2010-10-26,"So, after wandering about the Soviet-inspired city-planning horror that is Karl Marx Allee, I was hungry and needed a good meal... and on a cold and rainy Saturday, with the streets almost empty, I ventured into this welcoming spot.

Unexpectedly, a menu in English appeared, the owner was more than accommodating in getting me a glass of water (with ICE!) they he didn't bill me for! The build out is top notch - comfortable and decorous, without being schmaltzy like some asian places.

I ordered a sublime sweet and sour chicken - a meal that was simply perfect in so many ways.... and, honestly, a portion I should hav shared with someone else, but greedily ate most of it. Nice touch: The plate is served on a small pedestal that holds a candle to keep it warm as you dine. It looks great and actually works.

For many cities, this place would probably get 4 stars, but here in Berlin - they get 5 for the extras."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-05-24,"First off, loved all the fish tanks that this restaurant had. The food was very good and filling. The portion sizes were really good for the price. I went with some friends so we were able to pick and choose a ton of dishes and split everything. Worked out to be a high quality dinner that also gave each of us a variety of food."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-05-23,Nice restaurant. Good service nice portions of food would  definitely go there again. Best chinese i have had in berlin
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-07-24,"The food and service were both outstanding  I highly recommend this place. 

It is a quiet little restaurant with a relaxing atmosphere. The service was great. They brought our dishes out on a warmer so we could take our time eating and it never got cold. 

They have a great selection of dishes and drinks. So if you're looking for a place with great prices and great food, this is it!"
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2015-03-31,Good pricess and good chinese food. I have only went there for a take-away meal. Perfect for that.
Zhong Hua,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2013-03-08,"We go here almost every week since we have moved in this neighborhood. The typical decorated spacy place is purely family-driven, owner Si Mei is very very friendly. The food is mandarin cuisine, just excellent and prizes are absolutely low. My recommendation is the hot plate with prawns."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-09-30,"very delicious! especially all kinds of local Cantonese style DIM-SUM, which stands out among other chinese restaurant~"
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-07-06,"Visiting from New York City  for only five days and was lucky enough to be brought to this exquisite restaurant by my friend Jake. Better than any of the restaurants back home - freshest flavors and most delicious combinations I've encountered. Tofu has never tasted so good - whether quickly deep fried or sautйed or smoked. Shumai and wontons were perfect and light and wasabi shrimp out of this world.  And how can a humble cucumber salad be that amazing?
Gracious service; beautiful outdoor setting, lovely bottle of Albariсo and above all scrumptious food. A must."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-02-25,"Like just : AMAZING ! 
once you go there ...you'll just wish /want to move to Berlin just to be able to try all dishes EVERY DAY !
on top of being delicious they are decorated in such an exquisite and elegant way that can only assure you ""you won't be disappointed""
hope you will all enjoy as much as i did. definitely recommendable! 
service is super sweet, the place has a great decoration, all is very clean
my best advise is : GO ! GO ! GO!  TRY! TRY!"
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2016-12-09,"Nothing special. It's pretty much your average Chinese place, but a bit more expensive. The dim sum is better than the Hauptgerichte."
FeedBack,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,1,2016-04-02,"Really confused by the reviews and I am not even a foodie.  I had their version of Kung Po chicken and it was almost inedible and the dish was about 50% oyster sauce with very little meat.  They do have a nice outdoor eating area if you just want to have a beer, but I would stay away from the food if you are remotely used to real Chinese food."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-10-22,"Hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area that are willing to make the food as spicy as we would like it to be. 

The owner was quick to help us order the correct amount of spice and the woman cooking in the back was responsive to the spice level. Normally, Germans do not like much spice in their food. Rest assured if you ask for spicy food, you will get it. 

Really enjoyed the variety of food available. 4 different items, 3 drinks for 50А is a good meal. We will be back!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-10-11,"Best Chinese food I've ever had! No English menus but the waitress was beyond helpful. I actually ate here on my one night alone while my husband was at a work conference, and enjoyed every bite of my solo dining experience!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-07-01,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant by far. Their food is excellent - I have never had a dish I didn't like - and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you happen to be in the area around lunch time, try one of their soups (with fresh, homemade noodles!). The dishes can get quite spicy, but you can always ask beforehand if you're not sure."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-04-18,"This place is perfectly authentic! It's a small tidy restaurant, the dishes are so delicious and the price is reasonable. You can ask for recommendations and you won't be disappointed!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-09-17,"I haven't been to China, but this is what I picture as more of (from what I've seen on TV and from how friends describe it) as more authentic Chinese cuisine. Small place, very quaint but nice. My wife and brother in law had a chicken dish with green veggies (mostly onions and Lima beans, IIRC). It was very light in flavor, but in a good way. They both really liked it. I had a hot broth dish with some really great chili spices, beef, potatoes, and veggies. It had some real kick to it, but was pretty great. They served a family pot of white rice to eat everything with. Ended up being a little over А10 per person I think. We will definitely be back here to try more dishes, strongly recommend."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-03-21,The food is exceptional and the service quick/friendly.   We ordered vegetarian food and left quite satisfied.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Be sure to get a reservation on peak nights as the restaurant is usually very busy.
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-11-29,"Originally wanted to try a Korean restaurant nearby but it was fully booked on a Saturday night so we settled for Chinese. The place was pretty full as well so we sat at the bar. We ordered dumpling in Sechuan sauce, steamed halibut and spicy beef stew and finished off with steamed rice balls and sesame ice cream as dessert. All dishes were pretty authentic and tasty but the streamed fish was the standout."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-01-16,"A place I could easily visit daily! The food is exceptional , the staff are more than friendly and talkative too! Happy to speak in English as well as German .  I feel extremely welcomed and more than satisfied when I leave . A massive thank you"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-10-21,"This is a massive operation; right across the Chinese embassy. On a Wednesday evening, it was packed, with both Chinese and non-Chinese diners inside. There were plenty of Chinese diners; that for me was a good sign.

We decided to stick to ordering little things, and avoiding the main dishes. By the way, the main dishes are huge, so bring an appetite in case you want to order one of those (they come with rice). We ordered the 1000-year-old eggs (we liked it so much we ordered a second one), the spicy tripe, steamed dimsum with pork and vegetables, as well as small servings of the shark fin soup, as well as the sea cucumber soup. We also ordered a pair of non-alcoholic cocktails, simply because their juices looked interesting enough.

Oh, the millennium eggs were great! It looked disgusting, but it melts in your mouth. I loved it. I haven't had it here in Berlin, until now. I was missing it, so it was time to feast on it. 

The spicy tripe was also a great dish. It was not too hot, in my opinion, although I remember them marketing it as rather hot. I guess it's not Szechuan cuisine. Regardless, I loved it.

And finally, the dimsum, which was heavenly.

The soups were interesting, but I should say that the shark fin soup had more hype than taste. I can't say I hate it, but I am not a fan. I guess it is just popular because of its ingredients, but I didn't really see why people make a big deal of it. In my opinion, I found the sea cucumber soup tastier.

Overall, I had a good experience here. I would definitely come back again."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2017-06-03,"It's a reasonably nice place, the waiters were friendly, no problems, the food was... ok. Not great, but ok. The buffet is pretty small and lacks some more sauces (if you offer duck, fish, etc. by itself, I expect more sauces to go with it than just sweet&sour). One meat (I think it was beef) was only lukewarm at best and pretty chewy, which was also true for some of the other stuff. Personally, I would not recommand the buffet, but we will probably go again and try something from the menu."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2015-12-26,People say that it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin but I think it might be a bit overrated. There is a big selection of food. Even the most fancy things like shark fins. The menu is very authentic. My boyfriend and I (both from China) decided to have some daily food though. We had Dan Dan Mian (sichuan noodle) and sauer sweet fish. The portion of the sauer sweet fish was not very big. It tastes okay but not so amazing. The noodle was too soft and it was just a bowl of noodle. There should be more meat. The kiwi alcohol free cocktail was disgusting. The staff was friendly though. And the price was okay. Maybe I will try the all you can eat or the more fancy stuff some other day.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-06-08,The buffet is huge and full if interesting stuff... Very good for 15 euros..Some of the food are slightly customized to western tastes so that bit is irritating... The dumplings are fresh and tasty...Everything else is quite good and authentic.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2014-07-06,"One of the best Chinease Restaurants in Berlin. They have a huge selection of dishes on the menu, way more that you will find in a lot of other places. The menu is really Chinease with a lot of ""exotic"" dishes like pigs ears, intestines, chicken feet etc. We had some starters and some meat dishes. The portions are really generous and the meat dishes come with rice. I will certainly go back there, great find. 
The location is also nice, you can sit outside and have a direct view on the Spree."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2014-08-21,"I'm Chinese and the food here is awful. The Beef dish was too salty. 
We also got the duck pancake, wow the pancake they used was soggy and not the correct one I rate that ""F"" Bad Bad. 
Close to Potsdamer Platz there is a GOOD duck pancake place Pek-Ente or something.
Dim sum nothing special. Overall, I will NOT return."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2012-04-22,"Real chinese restaurant across the street of the Chinese Embassy. Once, when  I was invited to the 60. Anniversary of the Republic of China Act in the Embassy, this restaurant was the caterer. God food, some of them so authentic, that you are warned by the staff. I highly recommend this restaurant"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2012-07-08,"I gave 2 stars mainly because of the Unfriendly Waiter who made me feel sorry about asking anything,
I assume he's the son of the owner. Unfriendly and somehow rude.
Food is Ok, a bit on the pricey side considering the quality of the food:
We got Half Duck which was good, but the sauce was far too acid.
Rice was good.
Vegetables were ok, but not worthy of 8EUR.
Won ton soup with prawns is too expensive, 5,80EUR for a very small portion,
and taste too much like sesame sauce. 
I tried many chinese restaurants and this one is not gonna be on my list,
def. i won't go back to eat here."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-04-12,"This place is amazing! The location is very easy to get to, and the menus have ENGLISH! The english menu made the restaurant quite welcoming and put us at ease when ordering. 

The food itself is quite good, and the service is reasonable by Berlin/European standards."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-04,Authentic Sichuan cuisine. One of the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to when I'm abroad.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2012-12-30,"The mixed review from this restaurant is probably because of its originality and Non Asians, who are used to the cheap Asian noodles around the corner.

The food is typical food of the zhejiang province. They don't do dim sums, so I didn't bother ordering dim sum. I have been here a couple of times already. If you want to experience original zhejiang cooking this is the place and order from the menu. I've tried the buffet, but the quality is not the same."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2012-07-07,"Standing proudly just across from the Chinese Embassy I expected a great deal from this Restaurant. The food was mediocre, the restaurant looks reasonable nice and it's relatively clean. Although I got a dirty knife and a dirty look for asking for a replacement knife. The Mapo Tofu was not like any I'd seen before in my life and there was about 9 grains of mince in the sauce which I know because they were so few I could count them. They have a wide selection of Dim Sum and I had a selection, I was only really satisfied with one of the selections the others tasted like rubber (probably because they were using rubber in the steamers) . I have, unfortunately, no Idea where they got the good reputation they are supposed to have."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-14,It's hard to find good authentic Chinese Food outside of China.  This place is awesome.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2012-03-03,"fantastic food. huge selection from many Chinese regions and perfectly done. especially interesting is the dim sum selection  i cant seem to have enough of those and find myself coming back again and again.
the prices are moderate (45EUR for a couple) and the service is very professional.
on Sunday there is a buffet that is boring and not recommended."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2011-08-12,"I've been to the Ming Dynasty I several times, every visit has been a success, good food and good service. The highlight was the the Feuertopf (hot pot) which I shared with a friend one Christmas Eve. Lovely sauces and generous amounts of food. They top up everything as much as required, even the prawns which my friend really tucked into. The tofu was the freshest and the best I can remember having and it was the first time I had the sliced noodles. The peanut/chilii sauce is to die for.
I have also had the buffet for Sunday lunch. This is very good (and good value as well), if not as much a gourmet experience as the hot pot. A good selection of noodles, meat dishes,fish, spring rolls and even some sushi. In particular I enjoyed the crispy duck and the fried prawns/shrimps. The food is continually topped up so things don't run out, even the popular items.
Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town!"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2011-02-05,"Great dim sum,tasty wantons(i really love the fried one),to mantion the fried chicken with shenchuan pepper::is a twice fried chicken meet with skin,covered with a mountain of dry chilly.the dish havo no sauce at all and it's very spice.The desserts are bit boring,the usual banana frittes,and ice creams.
Authentic chinese food."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2009-05-29,"Terrific food, with a range of unusual items that one rarely sees in standard Chinese restaurants. No doubt its location right across from the Chinese embassy helps to get the kitchen honest. Certainly worth a visit."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2008-12-12,"Arguably the best Chinese in town. Good friends is good too and has more roast meats, but Ming Dynasty has a better dim sum and vegetarian menu. The wantons are really really yummy, with a little bit of lemongrass in the stuffing - miam miam. The only negative point is there a very light wine list: there's like 2 reds to choose from and no rosй (which is really de rigueur with Chinese food). Last time I was there I had the 'Great Wall red (produced in China) and it really wasn't that good. The traditional Peking Duck is a must (book 24hrs in advance), as well as the fondue (really popular with their Chinese clientele it seems)."

Lon MenТs Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2017-10-11,"I was here earlier for dinner, and I must say I wasn't too impressed.

We were early enough to not stand up and wait for a table. We ordered noodle soups and some dim sum as well as pig ears. Nothing life altering. Slightly overhyped even, I must say. The noodles were just okay, and I had better noodles before. Perhaps I am biased with ramen, but the noodles here had a flat uni-dimensional taste. And the dim sum and pig ears were also just ordinary.

I know other Chinese places that have more interesting items on the menu. So I don't think I'd be back here again, unless this is the only open option.

Oh, the air circulation inside could be improved."
Lon MenТs Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2018-01-23,It was a pleasant surprise to find this very authentic Taiwanese noodle shop in Berlin.  My wife and I ordered the beef noodle soups and spicy wontons.  Both were very good.

Lon MenТs Noodle House,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2017-02-22,"We came because we heard this was the best dim sum joint in town -it was good, but not life altering. We had chicken soup, the combination dumplings, the house fried dumplings, and peanut sesame noodles. The soup was delicious and the star of the show -moist chicken and a flavorful Thai broth, the combination dumplings were good, but 5А for 4 small dumplings was steep. The house dumplings were very delicious -very flavorful. The price on these was a little better (10 dumplings for 8А) -but still quite expensive. The peanut sesame noodles were good -they were served a little tepid. I would've preferred them served hot, cold, or at least warm. Overall, the food was good, but expensive for the portions and I've had better. The customer service was great. We were seated and served quickly. The food was made fresh from the kitchen, viewable from the dining room."

Although the Noodle House is facing the main steet, my partner and I did drove pass it. And have to check the house number to find the place. The shop is actually not so big. so better keep your eyes on their shop sign or the house number, if you on the way.

I have been looking forward to pay a visit for quite a long time, until recently finally got the chance for this. So as soon as we sat down, we were just looking for something nice from the meun. Of course, I ordered noodle soups with beef and fried noodle with beed as well. The soup one I think was alright. Probably, because I knew some other great noodle soup places. I really like the Fired noodle, it tasted very fine and delicated. Also we order XiaoLong Dao as side dish. it tasted good as well, but the potion was just small for us.

This place isn't self-service. It took a small while the staff came to us. The price of the place is great."

We also got xiaolongbao which was ok. The skins were a bit too thick but they arent a xiaolongbao ??? specialist so what we had was already acceptable. The dimsum combo (with hagaw ?? and siumai ??) was not that good though. 

Super cheap price and generous portion. Plus, super friendly service. The place is a bit small and might get a bit crowded during peak hours."

Starting from the best, the beef noodle soup was very good, lots of heat (you'll be sweating), with tender beef, the noodles were a bit flimsy for me but that could be personal preference. The pork chop with dry noodles were good, chili oil wontons just ok IMHO (I have a high standard, few places ever get it right), and gua bao was disappointing, lacking on filling and flavors (go to Street Food Thursday/Bao Kitchen).

Despite my criticisms, I will definitely go back to try more dishes, I'm still just happy I can find Taiwanese food in Berlin! Plus the staff is friendly :)"

That said, I was slightly miffed that their ??? seemed to follow the Mainland tradition of the dish; I was pretty hyped up about the prospect of eating a Taiwanese-styled ???.

Next time we're going to try the ""Hot Pot"" which seemed really popular with the regular clientele. 

Good to find a decent place amongst the more tourist-oriented restaurants in this part of Mitte."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-11-09,"We had a craving for hot pot, so we crossed our fingers and looked for the closest place in Berlin. Lo and behold, it was less than 0.3km away so we tried it and were incredibly satisfied when we left.

We tried the spicy and Chinese herbal soup bases, and thought it tasted slightly bland and not as spicy. However, we satisfied by how cheap it was for all-you-can-eat (13.50А per person). The downside was that water and tea were extra charge. 

The downside was some of the meat wasn't as fresh as we had hoped. The tripe and prawns looked dodgy so we opted for vegetables and beef, which were fine."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2017-02-01,"Fairly good food and experience, service was friendly. My duck was tasty. Unfortunately I woke up at about 2am with MSG head-ache and didn't get back to sleep for the rest of the night. They do mention that they use MSG in their menu, however if you're not used to eating I'd recommend staying well-clear of this place, because they obviously apply it by the truckload. Otherwise, if you're immune to the effects of MSG, I heartily recommend it."

Being Chinese myself i have high standards for Chinese cuisine and low tolerance for dishes seasoned with supermarket oyster sauce and the like. The sauce for the mapo tofu was definitely out of a can, and the sauce for the garlic eggplant as well. The dumplings were good but frozen industrial. This does not apply for the quality of hot pot, which I have not tried."

Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2012-02-24,"Casual dining, Chinese restaurant located a short walk up the road from the Friedrichstraяe rail station in Mitte (~5min walk). 

Menu includes a range of typical Chinese dishes, but the real attraction is their 'hot pot' specials where they set up a simmering pot of soup (you can get the soup as mild or spicy as you like) on a burner in the middle of the table with a variety of seafood, meats, vegetables and noodles to cook at the table. It's the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day! Prices for the hot pot combinations are very reasonable, making this a good value and fun way to share a meal with a group 

I have not tried many of the items from the regular menu, but did order their noodle soup for lunch once - I was not particularly impressed by it. Stick to the hot pot if you feel like a warm soup/noodle type of meal. 

They also have a small range of dim sum that are quite tasty bites. I like making a meal of it by ordering a few different items. Depending on how hungry I am, I can order more or less. My favorite here is the har gaw (steamed shrimp dumpling) with a nice dip in chili sauce before popping into my mouth."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-09-29,"OMG, food coma, reminds me of my days in China. Just the variety of sauces and quality of meat a tick below CN level. Actually surprising, but local food is maybe always best."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2012-07-12,"This was an excellent Chinese restaurant we happened upon our last night in Berlin.  Although we each had an entree (mine was actually not Chinese, but rather a curry - don't ask), we'd shared an assortment of dim sum (10 pieces).  They were excellent!  While both of our main courses were good, we'd eaten so many dumplings (and that's what we like the most, anyway), that we would have preferred just sticking with the dim sum for our whole meal.

I also had a mango lassi (I know, also not Chinese), that was very good, though not as good as Zum Moghulhof in Vienna (home of the Best Mango Lassi known to me).

I would definitely return to this restaurant for the dim sum, and the friendly service."

Overall, great value, nice surrounding and fun. Was pretty stuffed at the end of it so make sure you have empty stomach to get the most out of it!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2008-12-09,"This place does an unbeatable Sichuan hotpot (or steamboat) for 12.80 Euro for all you can eat. The stocks for the steamboat are pretty authentic although I didn't agree with the peanut dipping sauce too much. There are 3 platters that come with the steamboat, a mix of vegetables and noodles, a mix of fish and cow belly (which is much nicer than it sounds) and a meat platter of chicken, pork, beef and lamb. All of that goes into the hot boiling stocks and then you stuff your face as much as you want. Watch out for the dark Sichuan stock - it's apparently a bit too fiery for some people though it was quite tame for me. It all sounds good but after the second round, it gets a bit same-ish and one can end up rather bloated. But it is still a fun night out and a great economical place to take your friends for an unusual dinner!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2012-09-12,"Was einem am Lucky Star zunдchst auffдllt ist die tolle Inneneinrichtung mit einer Kombination aus chinesischen Elementen und deutschem Stuck die sehr ansprechend wirkt. Als zweites fallen einem die sehr gьnstigen Preise auf. Fьr einen Mittagstisch mit Suppe & Gericht bezahlt man ab 4,90EUR was wirklich sehr gьnstig ist. Die Suppe (Sauer-Scharf-Suppe) war sehr lecker und auf jeden Fall selbst gemacht da sie sich sowohl farblich als auch geschmacklich von den 08/15-Suppen bei den ganzen Vietnamesen unterscheidet. (Die Besitzer des Restaurants kommen alle aus Sьdchina.) Das Hauptgericht (Schwein mit Sellerie in Austernsauce) war vielleicht etwas klein. Was aber angesichts der 4,90EUR und der vorhergegangenen Suppe echt in Ordnung ist. Kurz: ein Lokal dass man zum Mittagstisch uneingeschrдnkt empfehlen kann!"

 The food is delicious everytime and ranges from honey spare rips to soft summer rolls. My personal favourites here however are the dumplings (because I like the word and also they taste great). They are traditional Chinese dumplings with a gourmet twist ( whitechicken or orangeprawns or blackbeef whatever you want) so you can`t go wrong.

The rest of the food we ordered like the peking pork was good, but nothing to write home about so that is why I only gave 4 stars.  Also the service was not the best.

The salmon was a disaster- overcooked, huge chunks of rock salt, underwhelming sauce and really for 8.50А it should have been at least twice the size. The best part of my 20А lunch was the house made lemonade, which was actually more of a light limeade spritz."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2017-07-08,"Quite yummy dumplings and cucumber slices salad! Came here for lunch with my meat-eating friends, not knowing if there would be anything for me. Luckily, I was happily surprised with delicious veggie dumplings. Sat outside with my puppy and enjoyed the view!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-10-13,Best Yumcha ever!! Get the baked Spring rolls. Quick friendly service. Excellent English but you must book! Saw so many people get turned away because every table was booked and it's only a small restaurant.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-07-08,"The dumplings were really amazing. My friends and I were feeling adventurous so we ordered many different kinds of dumplings. My personal favorite was the pink lamb. But I also loved the black beef and the orange prawn. They were super flavorful. The dumplings are big and very filled. Fat fat dumplings!! Just what I like. But the baked ones (which are fried) are kinda small.

I say skip the Shanghai dumplings -- no soup in a xiao long bao?! You may fool these Berliners but you can't fool me! I was Chinese in my past life. 

It's affordable but I kind of wish the dumplings were slightly cheaper so I could eat more of them!! For 10 euros you can eat 6 dumplings if you share with friends. I would certainly go back!!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-11-09,"I came here on a recommendation from a co-worker and was not disappointed.  The place is small but exudes a coolness factor. Located a short walk from Rosenthaler Platz underground on a quiet street it's easy to miss if you don't walk far enough down the street. Just walk past the Salumi place and you'll see it

I asked the waitress what amount of dumplings she recommended for 1 person. The waitress suggested I order 2 sets of dumplings so I tried the Prawn dumplings and the soup dumplings plus an order of edamame. 

The dumplings come in servings of 4 and are accompanied by 3 dipping sauces: a soy sauce-base one, a sweet one and a slightly spicier one. 

The Prawn dumplings were very good and the shrimp was not overcooked or mushy. The soup dumplings were very good too, however, they were not very soupy.  I would have preferred them with more broth inside the way they make them in New York's Chinatown. But the minced pork filling was flavorful. Two orders was definitely enough as I was stuffed so I am glad I didn't order more. They have a great selection of teas and juices here too. 

The service was quick and the waitress was friendly. Turns out she was from California so that explains the better than average service. I can't believe it took me this long to find this place. It ranks in my Top 10 and I will be coming back on my next work trip."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-06-19,"It' a small restaurant located at the conner on a street. The service was very nice and friendly. They greet us really well. Mother of dumpling was tasty, I really like it. Duck dumpling needs to change to beans dumpling because all I tasted was bean, just a little bit of duck meat inside. Beef Roll were to sour. 3 start for nice services and some good dumpling but others was not worth for its price."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-12-31,So good. Nothing else to add other than I wish I lived in Berlin so I could eat here everyday.
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-08-12,"Those dumplings will make you think you just went to Chinese heaven.

Start with the black beef soup - it's black dumplings dipped in a sweet/spicy aromatic soup, which tastes even better once it mixes with the fillings. 

Shanghai dumplings are a classic, try all three different sauces that come with them.

For dessert, nougat dumplings work quite well - they come with delicious vanilla sauce!

For a claustrophobic Hong Kong experience try visiting the restroom."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-08-14,"Fantastic dumplings and fresh juices.

This restaurant is famous for they yummy dumplings. The rumour was correct: 5 star! 

We tired the vegetarian, orange shrimp and beef (rind). So much flavour, perfectly cooked. 
With this we drank four juices as they were hard not finish right away; DELICIOUS! 
(Only fruit!)
Watermelon+lychee
Cucumber, ginger, mint
Lychee, lime, soda 
Carrot, honey melon, honey

On top of this super cute and friendly staff, good outdoor tables and a very cool toilet!"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-12-21,"The food is okay, but feels a bit uninspired; you could say it looks better than it tastes. A restaurant whose main selling point is the ambience rather than the menu."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-11-01,"Good food, but great dumplings.  Friendly staff and a clean restaurant.  You'll leave with a happy belly. :)"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-05-18,"Maybe I'm spoilt by all the great Asian food we have in New Zealand, but the food we had was pretty ordinary. I think ""Asian fusion"" can sometimes be used to describe something that isn't authentic, or good.

Prawn dumplings were ok, lamb dumplings were just a meatball wrapped in a thick pastry. 

It was ok, but not somewhere I would be raving to my friends about."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-04-16,"The place is very small so if you are more than two, you better get a reservation. 

Food is very good. Pretty fast and a lot of dishes. I would recommend to choose different combiantion and share them. Not all the Dumplings are the same size, even they are four per order. 

The menu comes in English for all of us who are not very fluent in German. 

Prices are not high and the service is very friendly specially for the host."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2014-08-04,"The dumplings are pretty good, but the servings are small. They always have a set menu for lunch special, and that was pretty good. They're not traditional Chinese dim sum, but I was intrigued and enjoyed the flavours for what it was. You probably will not fill yourself up here unless you're with friends, but the food is pretty good. It's hip and trendy, and there are tons of booths. I ate here alone, but they were still really accommodating to my needs.

I ordered a dumpling set with the soup dumplings, which were delicious and one of my first forays into the soup dumpling world. I also ordered the winter dumplings which were rich and a bit sweet. To top off my dumpling set, it also came with a soup, which was pretty good. The menu is simple, mostly based around the dumplings/dim sum. For a fast, quick lunch with good value, I'd go to Yumcha Heroes for the set menu. It's a relatively light meal (I think only three or four come in a set,) but it's affordable and has space for a lot of people, especially if youw ant to share. I didn't order any alcohol with my meal, but I did order one of those blooming teas which looked beautiful in a high glass."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,1,2015-09-30,"Waited 30min for dumplings! Dumpling itself was OK, however no spoon delivered for the soup
Unfortunately also no dogs allowed in the place, also not very charming staff"
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,4,2012-07-24,"Yumcha Heroes! 

I mean, the name is just catchy, right? It is. Couple that with the kitschy little sign of two dumpling heroes high-fiving...and well, can you go wrong? You cannot. 

On a beautiful, gloriously sunny evening in Berlin I found myself perched just inside the patio at Yumcha awaiting my first Asian cuisine in Berlin aside from the sushi/Viet outpost in my supermarket.

I was pumped. DUMPLINGS. Let's do this. 

The restaurant was comfortably full...the patio pleasantly plump with patrons. Tables turn relatively fast because the food is pushed out with a nice clip. Good for me, as I was famished after a day of soaking in sunshine (finally!). 

An Aperol Spritz (or two) found me as well as the Shu Mai dumplings (pork, serving size =4 for about 3 euro). I also ordered the Jacob's Chicken, which was good but in hindsight I would've rather had a plate of steamed veggies and MORE dumplings. The dumplings are where its at, I do highly recommend. The silk cube tofu was also a hit, but I think next time soup, dumplings, more dumplings, veggies. That shall be my winning combo. 

Service was good despite being full, and pretty friendly. I noticed they do take credit cards (not sure if its just German bank cards though), but I'd bring cash just in case. 

Three drinks (eeps, school night!) plus dumplings and a main entree set me back approximately 35 euro. Not the cheapest (though the dumplings are), what really hit the bill was the 16 euro chicken...which wasn't even close to my favorite thing. 

So, lesson: go get the dumplings. 

YUMCHA HEROES! High five! 

*ps pro-tip, skip their desserts and head across the street for ice cream."
Yumcha Heroes,Dim Sum,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-01-31,"I don't know what has changed, but the dumplings we had last night tasted awful. If I were to guess, they used leftovers from yesterday (or even days ago). The ""steamed"" shrimp dumplings looked just like the ""pan fried"" version - both were very greasy and the dumpling wrap/dough was very chewy. It also had a very foul stench.

Months has gone by since we ate here and we liked the place, but we're no longer going to eat here. Seriously, there are a lot of other places popping up that's offering fresh, tasty, dim-sum."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-07-03,"In a word - best dim sum I have ever had in my life, even better than in China!

Longer version (for the brave) - hands down, best dim sum I've had so far.

We've arrived here for dinner before it got really crowded, so if you plan on coming here after 20:00- reserve a table, the place is pretty small.

Once we've opened the menu we were thinking ""ok, so what do we not order?!""
As my friend is vegetarian, we had about 9 options to choose from if you exclude the ones with chicken/pork/seafood.
Which is quite a lot! 

So we've settled on four, all vegetarian.
The one who took our order asked if we're vegan or vegetarian, we said no but didn't really understood why - until he put complimentary prawn crackers on the table, super nice and highly considerate! 

For a starter we had a soup that was kind of tasteless until we added some soy into it, but as the dim sum arrived we forget about it.

9 - kakao traum, absolute best! If we weren't full after all the food we'd totally order one more round of those, perfect flavor, perfect serving.

The others we've taken were also really good, but this was really something else.
From our point of view this is a place you can't really go wrong.
There's no good and bad, just tasty and tastier!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,3,2016-03-02,"Hmmm apart from the very cute utensils and the super cute dessert baozi (one with chocolate in panda shape and one with strawberry jam in piggy shape) the other dimsums are average at best.

Ha gaw and dumpling are most likely frozen ones from the supermarket with super thick wrappings. The filling is tasty but the wrap just kills the merit of the filling. XLB is very disappointing :("
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,4,2017-05-25,"My first experience with Dim Sum. I can't vouch for authenticity, but it was definitely delicious.
Go early or reserve ahead. Space is limited"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,2,2016-05-02,"Worst dim sum ever.. Yes.. I got suckered in as I saw the miss piggy dessert pictures on other reviews. The miss piggy dessert was nothing but bread with artificial strawberry jam in it. The rest of the dim sum was subpar compared to any other authentic Chinese venue. I ordered the typical dishes shi jin bao, cha shao bao, dumplings with vegetables, glass noodles, and carrots, and xiao long bao. It just didn't taste fresh at all. 
Our server was nice and attentive. She gets 2 star for that. End of story. I don't know how this place has so many stars."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-07-10,"Tried it out if curiosity. I got a salad (cucumber) and  dumplings. I loved both. They have so many kinds of dumplings. I tried a couple and have fallen in love with this place. Situated in a charming street , I think the only restaurant I'm this side of the Street, this place has a lot to offer. Definitely worth checking out."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-10-26,"I wanted to try this place for some tjme and finally made it! Wonderful place for dumplings! Cheap, tasty, fast and a great service! It's a small cute shop in a nice area, the tea is super special. The menu is small but I find it a good thing. Their specialty is the dim sum.

Came her around 5 a couple days ago expecting to wait for a table (based on the other yelp reviews) but we were quickly seated and given cushions and a nice table spread to make sitting outside more comfortable. The waiter and waitress were very sweet and attentive and our food came out in a timely manner! The prawn crackers they serve before your meal are delightful. 

The dumplings were delicious and ask for the sweet chili sauce! It's really nice with the shrimp dumplings. The green tea is served in a nice porcelain detailed painted tea pot with adorable little cups. 

And every dumpling plate is А4.90... What could be better!

Wasn't a huge fan of the dessert chocolate bear dumplings but it was good to try. Can't wait to go back!"
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-06-15,"so, SO good. amazing prices (we drank and ate until we were stuffed, for under 25 euros). small restaurant and cash only as far as i can tell, but i would come here every day if i could. most importantly, EXCEPTIONAL service (which is a rare find)."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,4,2016-09-22,Very nice place to eat for cheap! Service was mediocre.
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-06-03,"I've always been a fan of dim sum. It's like heaven in your mouth. So when an opportunity presented itself to go to this place, I immediately took it. A companion was visiting town, so when we needed to have dinner, I suggested this place and made a reservation.

They don't have an extensive menu. They have two soup types, a handful of cold salads and other appetizers, about 5 vegetarian dim sum, and about 8 meat-filled dim sum. But that was enough to bring heaven to the inside of my mouth. 

My companion and I each ordered a soup, and I tried the wantan soup, which was delicate in its flavor and presentation. The wantans were floating in warm soupy bliss. It had just the right taste, and was meant more to enjoy and savor, than to simply slurp.

Then my companion and I ordered three different dim sum to share. With perhaps the most expensive order still being under 5 EUR, this wasn't an expensive meal. Each order have 5 pieces of dim sum, presented inside a steamer, and yes, they provide wooden non-disposable chopsticks. They also ask you what kind of sauce you want, as they have several choices at your disposal. 

Oh, the shao mai, and the shrimp-filled steamed mini buns, they were all heaven in my mouth. Next time, I'd go down the menu and try the other items.

I'll definitely be back. This is a great find, and is something that will be on the top of my list for a while. Reservations are recommended, as they are a very small place, with only a few tables inside."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,4,2015-09-20,"I love dim sum- it's my absolute favorite. This place was absolutely delicious, and they have some very unusual kinds. They have an entire selection of vegan/vegetarian dumplings, really adorable dessert buns, and unusual and flavorful sides.

The place is pretty small, but it has a nice homey atmosphere.  I'd recommend arriving before the peak dinner hours, or making a reservation. However, if they don't have any open tables, they also take your number and give you a call when one opens up, so you can explore the Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in the meantime."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,1,2015-11-10,"Edit May 2017: 2 years ago I visited the place and rated it with 5 stars.
Today I'm giving it just one star because the dumplings taste like supermarket frozen ones.
I expected fresh dumplings that are not teaming with preservatifs but there you go. Not gonna find that here."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-06-08,"Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it was still really good. The price was fair and the waitress was really sweet and on the ball. The other woman working there was also really nice as well. Definitely coming back."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-01-11,"So so so good. Loved the wonton soup and the rice wrapper pork dumplings! The perfect place for a quiet, low-key, delicious meal."

You're always warmly welcome, both the owner and the staff are very friendly.
A good place, to recommend."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,3,2016-07-02,"This is a cozy cute place. Offers mostly a small portion with about 4 tiny one bite size (no bigger than McNugget size) dumplings costs 4.5-5 Euro average/per plate. I would not consider this to be exactly cheap. If you are hungry and sharing, you would probably want to order about 3-4 plates each person. I do not have a size of cow stomach and I am a tiny woman. Do the math. Should not be listed as А. More like ААА for what it is."
Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-11-07,Amazing dumplings and friendly service. This is the best dim sum I've had in Berlin. Their tea selection is also amazing.

Lecker Song,Dim Sum,4.5,Under А10,4,2014-11-24,This little and tiny restaurant is hidden just behind Helmholtzplatz. The first time I tried to find it I almost passed it. Once you enter you are being welcomed by the friendly owner who offers you one of the very few buy cozy tables. They have various dumplings with many different fillings and tastes. I always just order a few and then more along the way. In that way you can spend a good and relaxed time with friends here. Food tastes solid but there is still a bit  room for improvement. It's pretty pricey as well but overall better than all the places along Kantstrasse. Certainly worth a try. But rather don't come in large groups.
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2017-08-28,"Really great dumplings here (it seems everyone here orders it). I heard they raised their prices and I did think around А9 is a hefty price for 20 (somewhat small) dumplings but I really did enjoy them and they were very authentic. I also had the kung pao tofu (А10) and it was quite delicious. Overall, the reviews are accurate, I thoroughly enjoyed the food but felt that it was a bit pricey in comparison to other Berlin restaurants."

I love dumplings! No matter whether it's the russians or the chinese but these were quality. Because I wanted to try them all I asked whether it's possible to try them all and when the waitress said ""yes"" without hesitating I was already in love with this place! The menu offers 20 piece or 40 piece options either boiled or fried. We took a mix of everything with 40 pieces and it's just the perfect amount to not be too full while still get a good idea of all their flavours. I loved it and I highly recommend to get a ""mixed platter"" (not on the menu).
Although I loved every single flavor the ones with salmon did stick out today..."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-08-06,"When you have a serious good appetite for dumpling and wish to get a dumpling satisfaction at a reasonable price - then Wok Sho is your place. 

20 dumplings (veg/pork/beef/lamb/sea food) for approx 7-8 euro with an option of boiled/fried.

This is coupled with a variety of Chinese dishes and drinks."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-12-11,This place is very over rated.  We sought it out because we love dumplings and saw good reviews online. We consumed 20 lamb dumplings (below average) and 20 pork dumplings (better but still just average) which we ordered mostly to see if we simply ordered poorly.  I suppose I'd go if I were invited there but I wouldn't go back.  Prices were good at 7.5 Euro for 20 dumplings.  20 dumplings and a beer each will leave you satisfied with enough room for dessert elsewhere.  40 is a lot of dumplings.  One last note - both of our orders were boiled.  Perhaps we should have tried fried dumplings.
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-07-17,"so... the food is really great. Flavourful, rich. The dough could be a little thinner but it's ok. I also like the short menu they have. Unfortunately the service is horrible. We were waiting for them to approach us first to get the menus and then to collect our order for approximately 45 minutes! If it was only depending on me, I would have already left the place, especially that there were only 4 other guests. Another annoying thing was that when we ordered all together 6 plates of dumplings they were serving us only 1-2 plates at a time. I would prefer to be served the whole order at the same time... The prices are also higher than before. Around 7 for 20 cooked sumplings and 8 for the fried ones. I am not sure if I will go back mainly because of the service."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-05-17,"These are the best dumplings that I have found so far. You get a huge order for a very good price and they are very tasty. Try the tofu soup or the cold chicken salad with peanut sauce as well. Very aromatic. I think these are the most authentic dumplings in Prenzlauer Berg. I would further recommend Lecker Song if you prefer something more visually interesting. Forget all the hipster places further south, though. They have no idea how to make a great dumpling serving like what you get in this place."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-07-09,"Just came from it, and yes, sometimes I go all the way from Kreuzberg to Prenzlauer Berg just to eat in there. When I'm in a dumpling mood, oh I love them and They have so many sorts, you can choose, fried or steamed; Let me tell you my favourite one:
Pork and Celery, steamed!

Perfect to go with a group of friends so you can do the full experience as the smaller portion is 20 uni, 40 uni the biggest, so It's good for sharing, combining ingredients and get to know more than just one taste, and they have that wonderful round table with second surface that you can rotate to get someone else's dish ;) friendly people and English speakers. 

Price is just perfect!

They offer dumplings with different fillings and you can order either a small or large plate of each taste.

Ordered jasmine tea, 20 cabbage dumplings (steamed), cubed tofu in a delicious sauce (I forget the name) and double pan fried chicken.  Total flavorgasm and I was stuffed afterward!

This place is a must. Be sure to make a reservation, we were rushed out after two hours to make room for people waiting. It was packed."

But, if you get off on giant portions, then here you go. You should check this restaurant out. 

That is to say, if you are the type of guy or gal who would say to themselves, ""I like seeing a serving of 60 of these dumplings on one plate and it makes me happy,"" then you will fall in love with this place. 

On a side note:
Why pay extra for frying? Are you trying to keep all the cheap and poor fat people away?

Also, it seems as if only Asian people eat here."

Kind staff, quick service, lovely atmosphere.

veggie/vegan: many options, my friend got fried tofu with noodles and said it was great

Appetizers: fried wontons are AMAZING (not huge portions, so if you're hungry get a few...they're only a few euros). The vegetarian spring rolls are also great."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2017-02-04,Nothing was tasty. The lime chicken was inedible; the meat felt like it's been boiled dry.

I honestly didn't have so many expectations looking at the price of the food which is relative cheap, but the dishes were simply well done, good quantity, delicious taste and pretty good varieties of choices

I took a chicken dish with Sumatra sauce with peppers, my friend took the duck. The chicken was well cooked the spicy was balanced the coconut sauce was not covering everything like sometimes happens with this kitchen type; the duck crispy and the side dish was made up of vegetables and a little sweet sauce

I think the fortune of this place at the moment is the a capable chef. You could cut the chicken with the fork

The place inside is nice; there is also a more elevate space for a couple of tables in the end of the room

I'm sure I will be back here

UPDATE 19/09/2015
Since I recently found this place I've been here 3 times (please don't go to imbiss so frequently!), trying different dishes, always with an excellent service"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2017-08-10,"This place used to be so good. Now the service is very poor, and the dishes bad quality. I used to come here all the time, but now I find there are much better places in this area. i have a pet peeve for restaurants living off of ""former glory"" and getting worse in service and quality.sadness."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2016-06-12,"Very good value! Cheap price and tasty food. Cozy restaurant, veeeery friendly waiters! The two of us ordered the snack plate as a starter, the black dragon and 4 small bowls (spicy fish, Sumatra tofu, rice and mango salad) as a main. Everything was delicious (especially the snack plate, sumatra tofu and black dragon). Good portion size! 
Will be back for sure :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-11-21,"Absolutely loved this place. First off, we were sat right away, which is a good start. We did come on a Saturday, and it was fairly busy. I love that you have the option of ordering smaller, sample sized portions. It gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes if you can't decide on what you want. We decided to start with Gado Gado, and (two) fried pork dumplings. This was my first time trying Gado Gado, and though I am not usually a fan of tofu, I really enjoyed it! And for only 3 Euros, it was definitely worth it. The dumplings were also great. I liked that they were pan friend, rather than deep fried. For mains, we ordered the Peanut Duck and the Lime Chicken. Both were delicious. Good presentation as well. My one complaint would be that the duck was slightly overcooked, which made it a bit chewy.  

Overall, the food was very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I am excited to go back, and next time, try a couple more dishes out."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2013-07-09,"Given the name of this restaurant, I am sure that plenty of people have come here to have a juvenile moment. Anyway, my companion and I tried this one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all, I have this idea that as Berlin has plenty of Asian restaurants, it cannot be the case that all of them are good. So perhaps there are more bad restaurants than good ones. This is coming from someone who is still surprised to see Thai and Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine in one roof.

Anyway, like I said, our food was rather good. And given the price, I expected something bare-bones, but what we got were rather swanky. I ordered the Sumatra duck, and it was said to be rather spicy. Beware of the red chilli peppers; they really are hot. My companion ordered the spicy duck, which was more a hot and sour sauce. Both came with rice. And we washed it both with iced ginger tea. 

Overall, I think it was a good choice. I'd be more than willing to go back here again when I have the chance."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-06-15,Ordered the normal chicken nudles and the duck with black pepper sauce&rice and couldn't decide which one was better. Also the service was great!
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,1,2016-06-24,"This place is terrible. Why did I believe the yelp reviews? The food is not fresh nor good quality and is masked in pre-mixed sauces, over fried in old oil and served in small cheap portions - reflecting the quality. The chicken looked as though it was breed on hormones and pumped with water and starch. I don't usually bother to write bad reviews but I feel stupid for going here and want to warn others against it. Tourist trap. Bad."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-10-07,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!

Best food, friendliest stuff, beautiful atmosphere, fair prices...always.

Try the chicken satay, the chicken wings, black dragon, the mango salad or peanut tofu... all at once! (there is an option to try several dishes in smaller bowls instead of only ordering one big one) 

Anyway, enjoy! :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,3,2014-11-02,"Aside from the creepy, questionably non-PC name, this place was aight. I like that in the menu, they specify what is in all of the sauces they use, since usually in an Indonesian or similar restaurant, I am not too familiar with the types of sauces they have. Other than that, I didn't think this restaurant offered anything too unique. The food was just ok and will do if you are craving Indonesian food. Service was again, just ok. The atmosphere was comfortable, but I honestly am not that convinced to come back again."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-02-06,"Amazing, this place was so cute and so good.Service was great and the courses were large. Note-if you take a rice table which is cool because you can share, the plates are really small..so if you are on a budget go for the bigger plates.. Would really recommend for a nice night out with good food..Have been there twice and I really think you can't go wrong...Delish!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-01-01,"Service & Atmosphere: Very friendly and prompt service. I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don't have to wait long for food

Food: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! 

Drinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.

Price: I don't know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each? Which is great if you want to try a lot of things and works out to be a similar price as a main!

In short: Definitely recommend this place!!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-02-22,A great find on a rainy night. Delicious food with authentic flavours for the right price. Very friendly and quick service.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2014-11-30,"Average, didn't know how it deserved the 4.5 stars. We all ordered different dishes with entrйe and from five people had no positive feedback. Give it a miss"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-01-17,We tried the vegetarian food and it was really good. I had the tastiest Tofus ever and I will definitely come again.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-07-23,"The food here was completely delicious, we were able to share a few small options between 3 of us, very tasty. The drinks are reasonably prices, and the atmosphere and service was very good!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2014-04-13,We really liked this place. The atmosphere was great. The waiter very friendly. The prices were good and the appetizers out of this world.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2010-08-12,Good Indonesian food here. I tried the rijsttafel (rice table) and it was very good. Lots choices to mix and match with just the right amount of spice. Prices are very reasonable to boot.
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2017-12-29,"Very friendly owner and authentic Chinese cuisine.
A cozy, family-style late night restaurant after opera."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-04-03,"In general, the food tastes fine, not really impressive but fair. If you want to have ""all you can eat"" hot pot, this place actually I feel much better than another one called Lucky Star which is also located in Berlin near U bahn station- Oranienburger Tor. With similar prices, here there are much more choices, I was surprised that they even offer scampi and mussel! Also more vegetables and the most important things is their stuff is much nicer than another. Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2014-05-13,Can be a Good choice for the chinese cuisine lovers. I ate a kind of noodle and it was OK. Good location and reasonable price by the way.
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2011-05-24,"To order their speciality-Hot Pot- is experience and food is good.Interier is not charming and service is slowest I ever experienced( for example when fire at HotPot dies and you would like to call service to make it work again...or even order one more drink) ,but otherwise still nice people and dog friendly place."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2011-10-14,"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Cosy, authentic chinese decor and music.  Very large variety of dishes on the menu, but limited beverage list.  Definitely going back!  Would highly recommend when you are craving some high quality chinese food!"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-10-28,"A vegetarian / vegan Chinese restaurant? What a cool idea. And very well worked out in this case. The food is good to excellent, the decoration is very nice and the service was great, with a young waiter doing an excellent job. You could see that he was loved by the regulars. 

Our favourite dish was the cauliflower, but the rest was also very nice.

Conclusion: Please open a location in Friedrichshain so we can come often!"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-02-15,"Good!! Nice interior and food. I go very often even its quite far from my place. They have menu ""suan la tang ???"", its good who loves hot spicy food but time to time its bad... ask for more spicy ver. If u  wanna try gooood suan la tang."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-02-09,"We were lazy last night, so instead of cooking, we opted to find some place near our neighborhood to eat. We stumbled upon this place, even though we were walking on our way to some other location, which, perhaps fortunately, had no place for us. So we walked into this one, asked if they had a free table, and voila, we were seated within minutes.

This restaurant is affiliated with the restaurant in our own neighborhood, Tian Fu, and since we knew that was a good choice, I had high hopes for this one. After all, this is quite adventurous: vegetarian and Szechuan. 

Given that there was a vegetarian constraint in this restaurant, I was impressed with the tasty selections they had. There was a section of the menu where they had alternatives: fake duck, fake meat, and so forth, but even if you don't go there, there are plenty of interesting items one can order. 

I simply loved the eggplant Yiuxiang-style. We also ordered a bunch of other appetizers (we're those snobby types that think that appetizers are more interesting than main dishes), and since there were quite a bit of eggplant, we opted to take the remainder home.

I am withholding a star for logistic reasons: there is a section of the restaurant that can only be reached by climbing the stairs. While we were there, someone tripped, and almost crashed on to another table. It would have been great if they installed handrails, or at least made the steps a little bit more visible. The current paint job of very creamy beige doesn't make it too obvious, and people might miscalculate their steps.

Otherwise, this place is great. I'll definitely be back."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-03-07,"What a fantastic restaurant. Great service, the food just out of this world. We got treated by the charming owner to a plateful of vegan calamari. OMG! Just amazing. This place is a must try for all you vegetarians/ vegans and spicy food lovers."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-11-02,"Dear Tianfuzius, Please come to Prenzlauer Berg! We trekked all the way from Prenzlauer Berg to eat here, and boy were we glad we did! We had Xiao Long Bao (Chinese steamed buns), Gebackene Wan Tan mit einer sья-sauren Sauce (fried Wan Tans with sweet and sour sauce), Tofutopf nach Sichuan-Art (Spicy Sichuan Tofu Stew) and Vegetarisches Gongbao Huhn mit Erdnьssen (Vegetarian Gungbao\Kung Po Chicken with peanuts) - every item was delicious to outstanding! My non-vegetarian friend loved the dim sum more than anything and I savoured every interestingly different tasting bite of the tofu stew that left my taste buds in awe! The dim sum portions were small but the entrees were big, especially the stew! The service was nice and the restaurant interiors were lovely. Prices are fair for the quality of the food, portion sizes and location. I highly recommend it!"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-10-17,"Now this doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has really good quality tasting Chinese food.  I brought my friend who lived in China for 5 years here, and he said it was the first time in a long while he's had a flashback of his days in China while eating the food.   On a side note, the waitress was very friendly."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2015-10-26,"It doesn't look like that but this place serves pretty authentic chinese dishes BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RED MENU CARD NOT THE PAPER ONE. I REPEAT RED!!

Because that's where the good stuff is.

I have been here twice one time I made the mistake and didn't followed the instruction and just ordered what was on the boards. (The food was meh)
After asking a fellow foodie I found out what to do:
You go inside and act as of you are fully aware of how this shit works like really confident and SIT DOWN. Don't go to the desks. May be don't smile. Just be very confident. If you look cool enough they'll bring you the red menu and you scored. This time the food was nice although I accidently ordered something with meat. The menu is totally random and has no specific order. But remember: You are aware of all that!

I had the pak choi with steamed egg (filled with meat as I found out) and hacao (which are filled with chicken and shrimps instead of shrimps only). Was still good.

Staff is ... Well it feels like this place is the god damn Berghain among cheap Asian venues. They don't smile and are not friendly but not rude either. It's weird."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-02-11,"This is straight-up some of the best Chinese food in Berlin. The outside can be severely misleading and the staff barely speaks German, which pays homage to the authenticity of the joint. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves tasty Chinese food!"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-11-04,"One of the best tasting Chinese restaurants I've been to. Do not let the ""Imbiss""-style store front scare you off, this place is awesome. Make sure you get the red menu, that's where the great food is and go for all the specialities."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2014-03-31,"Based on the reviews, I tried this place the other day. I also felt much better when I walked in and there were a number of Chinese people eating there... I ordered a beef with peanut sauce dish. It was just okay, I've experienced  much better but the price was about 5А..."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2011-07-27,"This place doesn't look like much outside or inside but it's actually really good. Great price and good taste.
The old chef was a real master, some of the best Chinese food I ever had, but sadly moved back to China in 2010, the new chefs are getting better all the time though, not quite up to the old standard yet
Choose from the menu, not the set plates on the board, much better food."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2018-01-05,"It's time to face the fact that Lon Men is not the only place that serves killer noodle soup. Shaniu's noodle house is one serious rival in the game of bowls and is not afraid to take the steaming throne.

The noodles are also handmade and the broth is rich and bursting with flavours. Don't be too shy to ask the staff, because the owner is adorable AF."

ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-02-18,"This place has potential but I guess I ordered the wrong thing. It is also not super chinese chinese but rather the lighter, softer less oily korean and japnese inspired chinese food 

I got the beef noodles (??????which was good. The broth tastes like shoyu (soysauce) based which is not something I expect from this dish. Then the noodles are inspired by Japanese ramen.  Well made but still not niu rou mian that I know. 

They have daily special for lunch as well and for thursday it is ???? or aubergine in yuxiang sauce which i was gonna order but i thick the eggplants were a big too thickly cut and looked like deep fried so i didnt order

Might come back later to try the squid with kimchi or the xiaolongbao

Service was great and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean and every dish is made to order by a very nice lady


Also, no tap water ?!?"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2017-04-29,"The light in this restaurant is a bit too bright, but the food they offer is quite ok. Rice can refilled and the meat or squid taste tender! For 104 beef noodle soup, the beef is chewy, noodle could be better and the soup is a bit too salty. And for 35 curry chicken, overall is nice but is actually not so specially which you could have almost the same taste as in other restaurants..."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2014-12-10,"The Beef Noodle Soup is really excellent and tastes just like in China. I have never eaten are more authentic and better Beef Noodle Soup anywhere in Germany. The beef is super tender, sauce has the right flavor and the vegetables are fresh.

Also all other dishes are really tasty. They are very authentic and taste like if you eat at someone's home in China. Therefore the dishes are not super fancy, but it's not needed as they just do everything right at this restaurant.

The restaurant is run by an old Shanghainese man and his wife. They are very welcoming, friendly and do everything they can to make their guests happy. It's one of those places you'll certainly walk out with a smile.

Highly recommending this restaurant. Consider to book a table on Friday nights."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2014-12-15,"After reading serval reviews, my partner and I decided to go to have try it out ourselves. Shaniu's noodle soup restaurant is quite close to the U-Bahn station Spichernstr.. From the station, it took me less 5 mins to find the restaurant. The restaurant itself wasn't so big, but very nice decorated and good atmosphere. 

After we sat down not long later the waiter brought the menu to us. I spent quite awhile just to see what food they offer. Most of them seem very good. But first I would like to try some sea food, so I ordered the seafood noodle soup, Shao Mai and dumplings. 

The seafood noodle soup I ordered was quite nice, very light and it tasted good, I think however it could be better, something was missing in the soup for me. Sadly to say, I have tasted something better in Berlin.  I personally like the dumplings very much, it tasted very special, only if there were bigger I would like it more. Shao Mai was also good. Dishes like this with such as low price, best thing could ever happened. 

After the meals, I started to with the chief a bit. She told me that their kitchen actually mix with Shanghai and Korean style. That was the reason dumplings tasted different, compared with other Chinese restaurants I have been. Some of the noodle soups reminded me the noodle soup from south of China, the looks and the tastes. The service was also really nice and friendly. During the time I was there, I saw quite a lot customers enjoying their meals very much, that was something.

Overall, I like it here, very cool price with delicious food. Although it isn't so close to where I stay, I could see myself come back again."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-04-16,"Super nice service, super nice homemade noodles and their broth is like CRACK!! Totally addicted after the first hit of spicy noodlesoup"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-11-20,"We had a great seafood noodle soup in this place. The slow cooked pork was not that superb (the sauce was a bit to jellylike and the meat quite dry) but the noodles were good.
Price/quality is good, we ate and drank here for 18А total."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-10-26,"This place was a good find thanks to all the yelpers out there. I ordered the beef brisket noodles, bok choi stir fried with shiitake and garlic and chicken with chili oil (was hungry). I was pleasantly surprised on how authentic these dishes tasted having gone to Shanghai a couple of months back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good food. As a added bonus, the staff was very friendly."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-02-10,"On a spontaneous decision, my companion and I went here. I have bookmarked this place already, having read glowing reviews before, so when we were feeling lazy and didn't want to cook at home on a weekday evening, I suggested heading here. 

I should say that it was a good thing that we came in a tad early: we entered at around 19:00 and an hour later, it was packed. I should suggest making a reservation even during the weekday, as I felt like we were simply lucky enough to be early.

I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, I loved the appetizers: the marinated pork knuckle was tasty, and the spicy sauce matched it well. The xiaolongbao, while rather diminutive and smaller than other soup dumplings I have had before, was also delicious. 

The soups, on the other hand, were good, but not spectacular. I had the noodle soup with pork belly: the broth was dark and tasty, the meat was good, but the noodles were a little bit too heavy for me. I couldn't see myself being eager and overly excited about this. 

Perhaps I am biased to the Japanese ramen: after all, having lived in Japan, that is my standard of what a noodle soup should be, and perhaps the Chinese variety is just too bland and zurьckgehalten for my taste. There's simply more bells and whistles in the Japanese noodle soup. Hence I am still giving this place 4 stars. The staff after all were great and did everything as they were supposed to be done. And since I haven't been to China yet to evaluate whether they really are doing noodles the way it should be done, then I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 out of 5."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-04-09,Excellent food. Duck and dumplings excellent. Very friendly waiters and owner. Price ok. I totally recommend.
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2015-11-22,"Last day visiting Berlin from DC. The service was poor. We waited 10minutes to order drinks. People were not pay attention on their customers. However, food came quick once we ordered. The beef noodle soup was fine. But the spicy chicken doesn't has any taste. Too plain. Only chilly oil but doesn't taste any spicy at all. The tofu with black mushroom
 was not good at all. No traditional sweet taste of Shanghai dish at all. Too much soy source on tofu & looked too dark. It's ok food. Clean place. Since it was rated so high, it came out disappointed. Was expected much more!!"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-01-08,"I have been here 2 or 3 times recently and have to say that it is very good, it's definitely not German-Chinese!!! :-)  I had Gongbao chicken on the daily specials menu, sautйed green beans, beef & bok choy on rice noodles and beef with onions. Most main dishes average 6А but then there are other dishes for ca. 9А (beef with noodles and beef with onions).

The portions are ample and satisfying."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-01-17,"I went here last night, after a very long trek..

I had the gluten cakes (like seitan) with mushrooms, bok choy with garlic sauce, fried veggie dumplings-they were all so delicious! I put tons of the spicy sauce on everything which improved it even more. The dumplings were the best I've had in Europe-small and flavorful with crispy bottoms-try them with the vinegar sauce.

The gluten cakes were really delicious and got better the more I had. The mushrooms were really good. I could have eaten two of those dishes.

Strangely, the worst things we had were the noodles-4 people had them at my table and 3 reported their soup/fried noodles were bland. The noodles themselves were good but the dishes they were in were overall ok.  I would recommend getting lots of the small dishes or vegetable dishes, my meal was perfect but those who got the noodles and not appetizers were a bit disappointed.

Would definitely go back though! The staff were also extremely nice."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-08-24,"Cozy little place that serves real Chinese food: we tried the beef noodle soup, fried eggplants w pork wrapped inside, and beef w/ broccoli. All tasted super! & the boss is super nice!!"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2014-12-25,"Totally hit the spot. Everyone was so nice and accommodating especially since we are beginner German speakers. I'm Chinese and everything we had was very authentic tasting. Very reasonably priced and delicious. Both my kids loved their food as well. We had 3 different types of noodle soups. We tried duck, beef, and pork belly...all were very good. Also the pan fried pork dumplings were excellent. Easy walk from our hotel on Augsburg Str. Large menu with many choices. Highly recommend."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2014-08-22,"Very tasty, and they have the soup-filled dumplings I've been looking for!  Handful of tables in Wilmersdorf, but a nice, clean eating area -- a big step up from your standard Asia Box, with competitive prices.  Menu is split between dim sum-style starters and various noodle dishes, stir fries, and soups.  The house-made noodles were packed full of gluten-y yumminess, and the dumplings were fresh and tender.  Will definitely make this a regular stop when we're looking for Chinese food."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2014-10-22,I agree that their dumplings are good. But I can't agree that their soups are all that great. Was a little disappointed frankly especially after reading all the great reviews here.

Fish flavour aubergine is so good."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-10-27,"Very inexpensive + fresh and flavorful = five stars.

Found this place walking through Alexanderplatz. Menu and prices looked good, so we gave it a shot. So glad we did! Prices are А5-А8 for carry out to dine in, the portions are sizeable (we were hungry after a day of walking!) and the food is cooked fresh and fast while you wait. Great sauces, crisp veggies, nicely cooked meats. For this price you can't do better."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2016-04-27,"Look, let me start by saying that, despite more good places popping up as of late, it can be really hard to find good Thai/Chinese/Eastern Asian type food, so it's all relative. So I am rating this place not on a grand scale of Asian food in Berlin, or even compared to the stuff I miss from the US, but relative to other Asian and specifically fast food places in Berlin.

As far as quick eats Asian places, this is about as good as you'll find. А4.50 will get you a box with lots of rice, veggies, and chicken (А1 more for duck) and your choice of decent sauces. After trying every other place around there this is the only place in this category that I have ever come back too, and now I come two or three times a week. Generally, avoid Alexanderplatz as all of the food around is garbage, but if you are there all of the time (I work one tram stop away, and food is worse by my office) and need a decent quick meal, this place is pretty solid."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2017-06-10,"Prima!! 
One of the best Chinese restaurants in Berlin!
The waitresses were very nice too.
We loved it!"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-02-11,"More like 3.5 stars but I think this place is a pretty decent chinese restaurant with great service and nice ambience

The place is smaller than I thought and there might be a bit of a wait if you go there during peak hours. 

Food was decent. 
The spicy chicken was a bit too small with too many peppers and not so much chicken yet the Portion is generous. The ??? was weird. Not really like what I have in china or the US. Mapo tofu was on point but lacks wow factor

super friendly service and Free rice/tap water :)

-1 stars for not honoring yelp offer and for having a lot of promos/campaigns yet servers seem to know nothing about those and the campaigns themselves are ambiguous"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-02-11,"Although I'm Vietnamese, I lived in Beijing this past summer and had a decent share of Chinese food. Disclaimer: I've never been that fond of it.

I've had better. That being said, this place was still good and reasonably priced. Vegetarian options available, service is friendly, and they speak Mandarin. And if it matters to you, many if not most customers were Chinese.

I did dock a star for not explaining/acknowledging the check-in offer."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2017-01-17,"Disappointing food for rather high prices. 
The atmosphere is dingy with the distinct lingering smell of bathroom, which already made me lose my appetite. 

The food was overall quite greasy, which is a character of bad Chinese food. The Szechuan fish we ordered tasted like old frozen fish, very stale and slimy in texture. 

Overall sanitation of the space was turnoff to my wanting to eat anything there. Would not recommend especially given the price of usually 20-35 a person."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-10-20,"My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.

As I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I'd rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I'd rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.

The second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it's a Lanzhou thing, I don't know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn't expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. 

The fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. 

The fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. 

Needless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-02-26,"A nice Chinese in the west of town, came here with a friend that is a regular and likes this place and he was a bit surprised to see that the menu and inteior design has changed.

The place as it is now looks a bit depressing, he said it was more authentic before. 
Now the walls are painted in a grey-ish brown tone with what seems to be some old traditional drawing on the wall.

The staff was very kind and the place was full of people.
The menu was packed with good things but because I wasn't too hungry I just had vegetarian noodles with fried tofu and could even barely finish - it's a very hearty dish with homemade noodles and lots of veggies! 

On our table there was a little wooded ducky with our chopsticks on it - loved it!

For starters we got a complimentary cucumber and seaweed salad.
Still can't understand how such a simple thing can be so wonderful, we tried to figure out what's in it for a little while - so sesame seeds, fresh chilis, garlic, soy sauce, little pieces of seaweed and probably some other stuff we couldn't figure out.
This was a highlight.

To sum it all up.. A nice place with good food, I'll come back to check out some more dishes :)"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2014-06-05,"A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Schцneberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? 

Turns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it's still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! 

I had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new dйcor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!

Anyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Frьhlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .

The Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  

My only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. 

My lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!

The whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about А27. 
Will come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-06-16,"A friend from Yunnan took me here with a group of friends. It was by far the best Chinese food I had in a restaurant in Germany!! Order their Sichuan and Yunnan stuff. It was soo flavorful and spicy and perfect! This is as authentic as it gets among the legions of sad Vietnamese ""China Thai Sushi Imbiss""....."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-04-09,"I'm Chinese and I think I am in a good place to say whether this restaurant is authentic.

Well it is. I could go there days in a row.

I definitely have a Northern's taste./They have good spicy stuffs./ They have original decorations (check the toilettes for ex)

Just sometimes I wonder what the waitresses are doing because they keep ignoring people......They are lovely girls though, whenever I get the oppotunity to talk to them....."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-05-19,"We loved it! Went there ysterday and had a fun time with great food. The chicken curry was especially delicious! A little bit on the spicier side though ;) waitresses are sweet, too."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2010-04-17,"Popular Chinese restaurant with a nice selection of open wines from around the world for 3,90 a glass. All kinds of guests - from families to a company that planned a trip to China. And then of course the incredibly sweet gay couple in love.


 Duck lovers will probably love this place, since there's a variety of dishes on that theme. I'm a seafood fan myself, so I had the ""Selig Plate"" of assorted seafood for 9,50 euro - served with rice or noodles.


 The seafood quality was good, but like all Chinese food, my dish wasn't really hot. We asked for some extra chili on the side to spice it up a bit."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-27,"One of my favorite Chinese place, fast service, staffs who can speak Chinese, English, German and Vietnamese.

Nice food, price acceptable, nice location"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-14,"We have been visiting Good Friends for over ten years now and have never been disappointed by the service or the quality of the food.
The restaurant can be quite overfilled on the weekend so to all the annoyed people out there: reserve yourself a table!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2017-06-28,"Went to Good Friends for lunch and ordered grilled pork, duck and stir fry Choi Sam. The service was good and efficient, unlike some other restaurants with arrogant attitude from the waitresses. Food was tasty though grilled pork is a little too salty. Definitely an authentic Chinese cuisine. Will come back again in the future"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-09-30,"I'm really happy that I could find a good Cantonese restaurant in Berlin,  So far I have tired many different kind of the Chinese cuisine, from different regions in China here. I always wondered if there is a one just for Cantonese. And then passed this place the other day, just couldn't help myself to give it a try. And it was just amazing, really tasted just like what I can have in my hometown. I ordered the most typical and delicious dish from here, the Cantonese roast duck.  It was really good, I enjoyed the meal a lot. Even my friends he wanted it so bad, the only reason he didn't pick it because of it got bones on it. But let's say he was a bit regret it, after he saw my dish. We also ordered some din sums,  the spring roll with shrimp was quite good, my personal favorite is the Har Gow (that is Cantonese, which means dumpling with shrimp). Just give it a try, you might love it. 

I went there with my partner and friends. At the end, we all enjoyed our food really much. The restaurant offers not only traditional Cantonese dishes, but also the westernize dished. So in this case, depend on the guest's mood, surely can find something on the menu. The restaurant is right next to the main street. It's really easy to find. Beside, you can have a peek of the roast duck from the window. Inside the restaurant has a really traditional Chinese style, how it decorated and how the tables set. It could be nice place to get to know some Chinese culture.  The waiters sort of remind me the waiters in Hong Kong, very efficient and don't talk much, but warm inside, if you need anything just ask. The price here is generally alright. When we were there, the restaurant was completely full, we were quite lucky , got a table without waiting. After a while we sat down, the waiting line start to appeared. And it was end until outside the restaurant. That is a good sign for the restaurant.  Just try to reserve a table, if you want to go. Otherwise it will really depend on luck and what time you are going. For me, no doubt, this is one of the great places for Cantonese cuisine in berlin. I will come here. Thumbs up!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-09-18,"One of my favorite restaurants in berlin. 
The food is really good and authentic. 
Good service and great atmosphere. 
Always a pleasure!!!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2017-02-26,"Good tradisonal chinese food, a bit stressome athmosphere. The service could be better..."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-03-03,"Visited for the second time today and food was really delicious. First visit went for sweet and sour chicken then on the second visit decided to try fried noodles with beef and I LOVED IT! Also, generous portions. Must try!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-05-18,"Had a family dinner at Good Friends just now. I was quite impressed by the food. Not bad at all. We are from Southeast Asia and has been traveling for alkost 1 month in Europe. 

We miss asian food and ""Good Friends"" is a good place to satisfied our taste bud"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-08-05,"Really good chinese food, try some fish dishes. Kind staff. A bit noisy and busy. They had TVs inside the restaurant for the Eurocup and I don't like football :("
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-01-07,"been there many times - and it is always a blast. We had the peking duck yesterday - which is a starter, actually. Even for me, the big eater: excellent."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2014-08-22,"I was here for dinner with two other companions earlier tonight. Since one of them wanted to try out a Chinese place here in Charlottenburg, we opted to start with this place. I placed a reservation earlier in the week, and when we arrived, sure enough, a table was waiting for us.

We ordered several dishes, all to share. We ordered the dimsum platter, as well as a wantan soup for starters. After that, we also ordered the pork belly fried with snow peas, as well as the chicken fried with asparagus. 

I should say that I had better Chinese food somewhere else. Not that this place is bad; in fact, the number of people eating here are enormous, and so they must be doing something good. But I have to say that there are other places that have more spectacular food, and this place just ends up as being okay for me. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would also want to try other places as well.

One tip: there is a difference between the orange part of the menu and the green part of the menu. The orange section is for Germans, while the green section is for those who want to try authentic Cantonese cooking. We only ordered from the green section of the menu, yet it still felt like I was eating Chinese food from the United States. 

Overall, not bad, but not stellar either."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2015-04-22,"I am probably biased, since I am not the best expert when it comes to asian food.

The staff was formally friendly (which is a diplomatic form of saying, a bit stiff on the communication side of things). Yet they were pretty quick, and the food tasted fine.

The pricing is more than fair, and the location is easy to reach with the public transportation system."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-06,Super yummy food and almost authentic like the food you may find in China.There are some pretty exotic cantonese dishes too.I was sitting close to the kitchen and was surprised to see the variety of the dishes they serve.and yes i was totally salivating!
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-05-09,Amazing! Nice dim sum. Great main dishes. Good desserts. This is the real Chinese food :) Everything falls perfectly
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2016-01-31,"Waiters are kind, but restaurant looks shabby and the food is the worst we've ever eaten. Nothing more to say."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-06-22,"After the bad experience at another Asian restaurant in Drsden called Good Friends, I'm going to try again with this Chinese restaurant called Good Friends...two times the charm!

We ordered the seaweed tomato fish soup which was seasoned nicely, and the soup was very good. The roasted pork/duck/BBQ pork over Chinese cabbage was moist and juicy..just right. Mom got the beef chow fun noodles, and that was fine. I really liked the fried halibut with black bean sauce ( which was a mistake cause we ordered steamed, so we got the fried fish for free). The clay pot of tofu, cow stomach and vegetables were nicely seasoned. The steamed halibut in light soy sauce was well cooked but I kept getting a mouthful of bones. The shanghai bok choy as fresh and light.

We did good here, I figured if there's enough local Chinese people in this place, then we won't go wrong like yesterday."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-08-09,"Not the best Chinese food in town in my opinion but it's always nice. The service truly is five stars. 
It's always easy to get a table."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-04,Best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Very big menu with regular and Cantonese offerings.  Large seating area but it is pretty busy so don't forget to call ahead.
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2013-11-30,"Many long-time Berliners have suggested this place, but to me it's just average greasy-spoon Chinese food--and expensive for what it is.

It is popular though, and finding an open table is a challenge. There must, must be better in this city. I will endeavour to find it and post it here for you! Soon."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2013-04-16,"You must set expectations here not too high! The Interior is completely outdated, it is loud and crowded! The waiter quickly overloaded and in Streя and forget ever order one or the other.
The food was  partly  good, the fish is unfortunately not quite through. To order a second drink, you have to wait long.
But even so I would have a second chance Good Friends."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2014-07-24,"Truly authentic, fresh and beautifully tasty Chinese food.

The eggplant is really good. Nice authentic Chinese food and great service. Oh, and you can get hot pot too! Just call ahead to book it :)"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2017-02-26,"I tried a soup and the vegetarian dumplings - nothing to write home about, but the service was ok and nice."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-04-07,"Excellent and authentic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin. It's probably my favorite Chinese restaurant outside of China or Los Angeles. It is so good. I recommend the pork soup dumplings, pork belly, beef tripe, and jellyfish and cucumber. It's fun for me to read the menu in Chinese and German when my primary language is English. The wait staff speak it all so be comfortable ordering. I hope this restaurant stays in business forever. Perhaps they can open up a location in West Berlin too."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-11-01,"I don't like given Chinese restaurants bad reviews since I'm Chinese myself, but this place does not deserve 4.5 stars.  First of all they serve jasmine rice instead of traditional sticky rice. Also, the dumplings and tofu were the cheaper store bought kind.  I don't expect homemade tofu everywhere, but at least spend the extra 20 cents and buy the silken tofu for your mapo tofu.  I will say the waiter was very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-06-08,"The food is nothing special at all. I guess the right word would be ""edible"". So, no reason to go. Also, that waitress sure was awkward and not very good."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-11-04,"Our group of four had an excellent meal here last week. Service was fine (by Berlin standards) and, more important, the menu was varied and the food tasted great--the spicy dishes were actually spicy (and not Germanized into blandness). We had the Qualle (quail egg) appetizer, Aubergine appetizer, and the boneless chicken in Szechuan chili oil sauce to start--all very good. For main courses, we had Gongbao chicken, lamb with coriander, and the pork belly (favorite of Chairman Mao, supposedly). All very tasty."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-08-02,This restaurant deserves more recognition. Very good food at decent price. Huge menu.
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2016-04-02,"The only reason I've given this restaurant 1 star is because the food is good. I'm not going to go into detail but if there's more than 2 people in the restaurant, don't bother. You could be waiting hours for your food. More attention is given to take-aways than guests VERY patiently waiting hours. And I do mean HOURS! Never again!!!!

UPDATE!!
Went there again! The restaurant looked pretty quiet so we went in to give it another chance. 
The food was typically good and there were 'TWO' pleasant waitresses BUT, as we waited and waited for our food, numerous take-out customers came in to collect food and at one point, most of the customers were Deliveroo and Foodora deliverers. Is this the way restaurants are going?
We were getting to the point of 'where's our food!!!' when it arrived. 

The Mayflower should downsize to being a take-away restaurant and save on rental space. It clearly gives take-out customers preference. Seriously. That WAS the last time!"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2016-07-20,"This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot and sour soup was as sweet as ice cream, stank of vinegar and it was not spicy(hot) at all. The Gongbau chicken was mostly tiny bits of chicken and cabbage swimming in a sickening red-orange gloppy sauce, with perhaps three peanuts. It was not spicy. While Berlin can be a difficult city for Chinese cuisine, there are much, much better options. The owners should be ashamed: this is of such a low standard I can't comprehend how you could knowingly serve this food to customers. While I can see some other Yelpers have liked it, I wonder what their standards might be..."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-06-10,Most amazing Chinese restaurant with the best Sichuan cuisine I've experienced so far in Berlin!
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-11,Their noodles are honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavors are earthy and sophisticated and the food is super fresh and a lot is made daily like the noodles and broth. The food here has a great mix of textures and flavors that come together perfectly. Their desserts are super amazing too - not too sweet and also very aromatic. Seriously you will not be disappointed!
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-03-10,"This is an amazing place for fans of genuine Chinese (Sichuan) food. Taste and authenticity is the focal point here, and the staff's love for food shines through in all dishes. The ""Ahorn"" noodle dish is recommended!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-06-15,"Probably the best food all along the Brunnenstr. Had tried soups and noodles dishes, and they are all great. It's possible to discover up to 10 different flavors inside a simple baked potato. One of my favorites recently."
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-12-09,The noodles are spectacular. One of the best new additions to the Berlin food scene.
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-02-26,"Elegant, charming ambience. Cozy, intimate and full of beauty. The owners are super nice, make you feel right at home. And the food, oh the food is spectacular! I've been here four times already and it has been consistently good. Just the right balance of flavor, spice and home cooked goodness. Just delicious!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2016-12-08,"Peaceful ambience. Organic concept. The corner booth cubicals are an enriched idealism that in reality is quite uncomfortable; ambitious cross-leggers may suit these tables. Plating technique was beautiful but heavily lacked in flavor and depth. Service was very kind however, and as it is a new Restaurant it would surely evolve into something spectaular in the future."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-10-22,"Hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area that are willing to make the food as spicy as we would like it to be. 

The owner was quick to help us order the correct amount of spice and the woman cooking in the back was responsive to the spice level. Normally, Germans do not like much spice in their food. Rest assured if you ask for spicy food, you will get it. 

Really enjoyed the variety of food available. 4 different items, 3 drinks for 50А is a good meal. We will be back!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-10-11,"Best Chinese food I've ever had! No English menus but the waitress was beyond helpful. I actually ate here on my one night alone while my husband was at a work conference, and enjoyed every bite of my solo dining experience!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2017-07-01,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant by far. Their food is excellent - I have never had a dish I didn't like - and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you happen to be in the area around lunch time, try one of their soups (with fresh, homemade noodles!). The dishes can get quite spicy, but you can always ask beforehand if you're not sure."
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-04-18,"This place is perfectly authentic! It's a small tidy restaurant, the dishes are so delicious and the price is reasonable. You can ask for recommendations and you won't be disappointed!"
Jing Yang,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-09-17,"I haven't been to China, but this is what I picture as more of (from what I've seen on TV and from how friends describe it) as more authentic Chinese cuisine. Small place, very quaint but nice. My wife and brother in law had a chicken dish with green veggies (mostly onions and Lima beans, IIRC). It was very light in flavor, but in a good way. They both really liked it. I had a hot broth dish with some really great chili spices, beef, potatoes, and veggies. It had some real kick to it, but was pretty great. They served a family pot of white rice to eat everything with. Ended up being a little over А10 per person I think. We will definitely be back here to try more dishes, strongly recommend."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-02-03,"Best Chinese I know. Always delicious and friendly. Very reasonably priced as well.
Lunch menue is unbeatable in quality and price! Tastebuds what'ya say ?
YUMMIE"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-07-26,"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Food is great, spicy but acceptable because of the quality and the freshness of the food. Lots of Chinese restaurant is using glutamates to cover and give the impression of Chinese food. Here none, it's just well prepared with delicious and fresh vegetables. We loved it really!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2015-06-08,"Really good Chinese food! Had spicy chicken with pineapple, carrots and peppers. It was really solid. Nice interior, very clean and modern, white tablecloth kinda place. Very nice service and a menu in English. Much appreciated!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2014-10-01,"Been here twice. Great Chinese food! The chicken was tender and fresh and the veggies were perfect. Friendly, fast service as well. Nice quiet neighborhood to walk around in as well. Will definitely come back for the dim sum which looked delicious."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2014-09-11,"Not bad, it's exactly Chinese style. The boss is from Zhejiang, the soup is good, home style."
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2011-10-18,"Great authentic Chinese food at reasonable price. The location is great although it might have been a little cosier if the lighting would have been a little bit darker.
I tried a very spicy chicken, believing it would be Sichuan spicy. This was not the case. The chicken was great but not as spicy as expected.
I would easily recommend this place!"
East Restaurant,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2011-01-29,At the moment this is one of my favourite chinese restaurant in Berlin. The food is delicious!
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-12-31,"For Chinese Food in Berlin on New Years Eve, without reservations, this was a solid choice.  Service was fast, the menu was extensive, and the dishes I ordered were perfect.  It's a large ""hall"" style Chinese restaurant, with a lot of tables, and a few smaller seating areas built inside, but it wasn't too noisy, and didn't feel cramped at all.

I'd definitely go back if I wanted Chinese food and were in Mitte."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2016-08-04,"I am not really a Chinese enthusiast, but the food, service, and location is good. I ordered the mini vegetable egg rolls, fried noodles with chicken, fried noodles with beef, chicken, and another meat that I can't remember, and fried rice.  I would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-06-04,"The most authentic Chinese restaurant I found so far in Berlin, should not be missed for ones looking for real Chinese foods but western Asian."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-05-19,"As a suggestion from one of my co-workers in Berlin, I ate here with my boss during a business trip to Berlin for dinner.  What a great choice!

The service was fast, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was okay.  Plus it was in walking distance from the Courtyard Marriott where we were staying.

Another place on my list when staying in Berlin."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2015-03-27,"Lots of options but the quality isn't that great. The staff is helpful. I do like the ambience. Spacious. I got the fried noodles with chicken, beef and vegetables. It was a bit too oily and not all that flavourful. For what you pay you can get better portions elsewhere."
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-03-15,Too much MSG and the green peppers tasted moldy. might have been my taste buds so I give three stars. overall quite generic.
China City,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2014-06-15,"Avoid at all costs if you don't to be treated as an intrusion rather than paying customer. I usually trust Yelp reviews because I know the reviewers care about great food as much as I do but this time I totally disagree with previous reviewers.

We chose this restaurant due to its closeness to our hotel rather than one with better reviews a distance away.  From the minute we entered I have never encountered such disdain, rudeness and lack of interest on behalf of the restaurant staff.  After 10 minutes after seating we still had not been greeted at table even though only 3 tables filled in restaurant.  Eventually got attention of waiter and the evening went down after.  His attitude was downright hostile - could it have been because we spoke English and not German? We were  a diverse group with Malaysia, Indonesia, Indian and US represented out to have a nice business dinner.

Now the food- pan fried dumplings okay, soups poor. Mains- crispy duck in Szechuan sauce & prawns in paprika-pepper both 3.5 stars.  Fried fish filet with mushrooms - no flavor & no fish!  Sweet & sour pork - 2 stars.

Decor- dated tacky Chinese decor with abundance of dirty/dusty fake flowers everywhere.

All in all- would have give 3 star but cannot tolerate or accept such rude and indifferent wait staff."

The eggplant is really good. Nice authentic Chinese food and great service. Oh, and you can get hot pot too! Just call ahead to book it :)"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2017-02-26,"I tried a soup and the vegetarian dumplings - nothing to write home about, but the service was ok and nice."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-04-07,"Excellent and authentic! This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berlin. It's probably my favorite Chinese restaurant outside of China or Los Angeles. It is so good. I recommend the pork soup dumplings, pork belly, beef tripe, and jellyfish and cucumber. It's fun for me to read the menu in Chinese and German when my primary language is English. The wait staff speak it all so be comfortable ordering. I hope this restaurant stays in business forever. Perhaps they can open up a location in West Berlin too."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-11-01,"I don't like given Chinese restaurants bad reviews since I'm Chinese myself, but this place does not deserve 4.5 stars.  First of all they serve jasmine rice instead of traditional sticky rice. Also, the dumplings and tofu were the cheaper store bought kind.  I don't expect homemade tofu everywhere, but at least spend the extra 20 cents and buy the silken tofu for your mapo tofu.  I will say the waiter was very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-06-08,"The food is nothing special at all. I guess the right word would be ""edible"". So, no reason to go. Also, that waitress sure was awkward and not very good."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-11-04,"Our group of four had an excellent meal here last week. Service was fine (by Berlin standards) and, more important, the menu was varied and the food tasted great--the spicy dishes were actually spicy (and not Germanized into blandness). We had the Qualle (quail egg) appetizer, Aubergine appetizer, and the boneless chicken in Szechuan chili oil sauce to start--all very good. For main courses, we had Gongbao chicken, lamb with coriander, and the pork belly (favorite of Chairman Mao, supposedly). All very tasty."
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2016-08-02,This restaurant deserves more recognition. Very good food at decent price. Huge menu.
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2016-04-02,"The only reason I've given this restaurant 1 star is because the food is good. I'm not going to go into detail but if there's more than 2 people in the restaurant, don't bother. You could be waiting hours for your food. More attention is given to take-aways than guests VERY patiently waiting hours. And I do mean HOURS! Never again!!!!

UPDATE!!
Went there again! The restaurant looked pretty quiet so we went in to give it another chance. 
The food was typically good and there were 'TWO' pleasant waitresses BUT, as we waited and waited for our food, numerous take-out customers came in to collect food and at one point, most of the customers were Deliveroo and Foodora deliverers. Is this the way restaurants are going?
We were getting to the point of 'where's our food!!!' when it arrived. 

The Mayflower should downsize to being a take-away restaurant and save on rental space. It clearly gives take-out customers preference. Seriously. That WAS the last time!"
Mayflower,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2016-07-20,"This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot and sour soup was as sweet as ice cream, stank of vinegar and it was not spicy(hot) at all. The Gongbau chicken was mostly tiny bits of chicken and cabbage swimming in a sickening red-orange gloppy sauce, with perhaps three peanuts. It was not spicy. While Berlin can be a difficult city for Chinese cuisine, there are much, much better options. The owners should be ashamed: this is of such a low standard I can't comprehend how you could knowingly serve this food to customers. While I can see some other Yelpers have liked it, I wonder what their standards might be..."

We were early enough to not stand up and wait for a table. We ordered noodle soups and some dim sum as well as pig ears. Nothing life altering. Slightly overhyped even, I must say. The noodles were just okay, and I had better noodles before. Perhaps I am biased with ramen, but the noodles here had a flat uni-dimensional taste. And the dim sum and pig ears were also just ordinary.

I know other Chinese places that have more interesting items on the menu. So I don't think I'd be back here again, unless this is the only open option.

Oh, the air circulation inside could be improved."

We had chicken soup, the combination dumplings, the house fried dumplings, and peanut sesame noodles. The soup was delicious and the star of the show -moist chicken and a flavorful Thai broth, the combination dumplings were good, but 5А for 4 small dumplings was steep. The house dumplings were very delicious -very flavorful. The price on these was a little better (10 dumplings for 8А) -but still quite expensive. The peanut sesame noodles were good -they were served a little tepid. I would've preferred them served hot, cold, or at least warm. Overall, the food was good, but expensive for the portions and I've had better. The customer service was great. We were seated and served quickly. The food was made fresh from the kitchen, viewable from the dining room."

Although the Noodle House is facing the main steet, my partner and I did drove pass it. And have to check the house number to find the place. The shop is actually not so big. so better keep your eyes on their shop sign or the house number, if you on the way.

I have been looking forward to pay a visit for quite a long time, until recently finally got the chance for this. So as soon as we sat down, we were just looking for something nice from the meun. Of course, I ordered noodle soups with beef and fried noodle with beed as well. The soup one I think was alright. Probably, because I knew some other great noodle soup places. I really like the Fired noodle, it tasted very fine and delicated. Also we order XiaoLong Dao as side dish. it tasted good as well, but the potion was just small for us.

This place isn't self-service. It took a small while the staff came to us. The price of the place is great."

We also got xiaolongbao which was ok. The skins were a bit too thick but they arent a xiaolongbao ??? specialist so what we had was already acceptable. The dimsum combo (with hagaw ?? and siumai ??) was not that good though.

Starting from the best, the beef noodle soup was very good, lots of heat (you'll be sweating), with tender beef, the noodles were a bit flimsy for me but that could be personal preference. The pork chop with dry noodles were good, chili oil wontons just ok IMHO (I have a high standard, few places ever get it right), and gua bao was disappointing, lacking on filling and flavors (go to Street Food Thursday/Bao Kitchen).

Despite my criticisms, I will definitely go back to try more dishes, I'm still just happy I can find Taiwanese food in Berlin! Plus the staff is friendly :)"

That said, I was slightly miffed that their ??? seemed to follow the Mainland tradition of the dish; I was pretty hyped up about the prospect of eating a Taiwanese-styled ???.

Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-02-11,"More like 3.5 stars but I think this place is a pretty decent chinese restaurant with great service and nice ambience

The place is smaller than I thought and there might be a bit of a wait if you go there during peak hours. 

Food was decent. 
The spicy chicken was a bit too small with too many peppers and not so much chicken yet the Portion is generous. The ??? was weird. Not really like what I have in china or the US. Mapo tofu was on point but lacks wow factor

super friendly service and Free rice/tap water :)

-1 stars for not honoring yelp offer and for having a lot of promos/campaigns yet servers seem to know nothing about those and the campaigns themselves are ambiguous"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-02-11,"Although I'm Vietnamese, I lived in Beijing this past summer and had a decent share of Chinese food. Disclaimer: I've never been that fond of it.

I've had better. That being said, this place was still good and reasonably priced. Vegetarian options available, service is friendly, and they speak Mandarin. And if it matters to you, many if not most customers were Chinese.

I did dock a star for not explaining/acknowledging the check-in offer."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,1,2017-01-17,"Disappointing food for rather high prices. 
The atmosphere is dingy with the distinct lingering smell of bathroom, which already made me lose my appetite. 

The food was overall quite greasy, which is a character of bad Chinese food. The Szechuan fish we ordered tasted like old frozen fish, very stale and slimy in texture. 

Overall sanitation of the space was turnoff to my wanting to eat anything there. Would not recommend especially given the price of usually 20-35 a person."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-10-20,"My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.

As I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I'd rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I'd rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.

The second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it's a Lanzhou thing, I don't know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn't expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. 

The fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. 

The fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. 

Needless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me."
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-02-26,"A nice Chinese in the west of town, came here with a friend that is a regular and likes this place and he was a bit surprised to see that the menu and inteior design has changed.

The place as it is now looks a bit depressing, he said it was more authentic before. 
Now the walls are painted in a grey-ish brown tone with what seems to be some old traditional drawing on the wall.

The staff was very kind and the place was full of people.
The menu was packed with good things but because I wasn't too hungry I just had vegetarian noodles with fried tofu and could even barely finish - it's a very hearty dish with homemade noodles and lots of veggies! 

On our table there was a little wooded ducky with our chopsticks on it - loved it!

For starters we got a complimentary cucumber and seaweed salad.
Still can't understand how such a simple thing can be so wonderful, we tried to figure out what's in it for a little while - so sesame seeds, fresh chilis, garlic, soy sauce, little pieces of seaweed and probably some other stuff we couldn't figure out.
This was a highlight.

To sum it all up.. A nice place with good food, I'll come back to check out some more dishes :)"
Selig,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2014-06-05,"A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Schцneberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? 

Turns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it's still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! 

I had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new dйcor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!

Anyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Frьhlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .

The Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  

My only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. 

My lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!

The whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about А27. 
Will come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!"

 Duck lovers will probably love this place, since there's a variety of dishes on that theme. I'm a seafood fan myself, so I had the ""Selig Plate"" of assorted seafood for 9,50 euro - served with rice or noodles.


 The seafood quality was good, but like all Chinese food, my dish wasn't really hot. We asked for some extra chili on the side to spice it up a bit."

Good to find a decent place amongst the more tourist-oriented restaurants in this part of Mitte."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-11-09,"We had a craving for hot pot, so we crossed our fingers and looked for the closest place in Berlin. Lo and behold, it was less than 0.3km away so we tried it and were incredibly satisfied when we left.

We tried the spicy and Chinese herbal soup bases, and thought it tasted slightly bland and not as spicy. However, we satisfied by how cheap it was for all-you-can-eat (13.50А per person). The downside was that water and tea were extra charge. 

The downside was some of the meat wasn't as fresh as we had hoped. The tripe and prawns looked dodgy so we opted for vegetables and beef, which were fine."

Unfortunately I woke up at about 2am with MSG head-ache and didn't get back to sleep for the rest of the night. They do mention that they use MSG in their menu, however if you're not used to eating I'd recommend staying well-clear of this place, because they obviously apply it by the truckload.

Being Chinese myself i have high standards for Chinese cuisine and low tolerance for dishes seasoned with supermarket oyster sauce and the like. The sauce for the mapo tofu was definitely out of a can, and the sauce for the garlic eggplant as well. The dumplings were good but frozen industrial. This does not apply for the quality of hot pot, which I have not tried."

Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2012-02-24,"Casual dining, Chinese restaurant located a short walk up the road from the Friedrichstraяe rail station in Mitte (~5min walk). 

Menu includes a range of typical Chinese dishes, but the real attraction is their 'hot pot' specials where they set up a simmering pot of soup (you can get the soup as mild or spicy as you like) on a burner in the middle of the table with a variety of seafood, meats, vegetables and noodles to cook at the table. It's the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day! Prices for the hot pot combinations are very reasonable, making this a good value and fun way to share a meal with a group 

I have not tried many of the items from the regular menu, but did order their noodle soup for lunch once - I was not particularly impressed by it. Stick to the hot pot if you feel like a warm soup/noodle type of meal. 

They also have a small range of dim sum that are quite tasty bites. I like making a meal of it by ordering a few different items. Depending on how hungry I am, I can order more or less. My favorite here is the har gaw (steamed shrimp dumpling) with a nice dip in chili sauce before popping into my mouth."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2013-09-29,"OMG, food coma, reminds me of my days in China. Just the variety of sauces and quality of meat a tick below CN level. Actually surprising, but local food is maybe always best."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2012-07-12,"This was an excellent Chinese restaurant we happened upon our last night in Berlin.  Although we each had an entree (mine was actually not Chinese, but rather a curry - don't ask), we'd shared an assortment of dim sum (10 pieces).  They were excellent!  While both of our main courses were good, we'd eaten so many dumplings (and that's what we like the most, anyway), that we would have preferred just sticking with the dim sum for our whole meal.

I also had a mango lassi (I know, also not Chinese), that was very good, though not as good as Zum Moghulhof in Vienna (home of the Best Mango Lassi known to me).

I would definitely return to this restaurant for the dim sum, and the friendly service."
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2014-12-11,"I was with a couple of buddies of and we happened to stumble at this AYCE place at Oranienburger Tor.  This place is honestly fantastic; we had heaps of fish, meat and delicious broth. I've gone hot pot hopping in Berlin, and I think this is genuinely one of the best places in Berlin from a hot pot perspective. I would definitely go again with my buddies sometime soon!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2010-01-24,"Fun place for a group of friends. Pretty authentic Chinese hotpot with choices of soup bases - ranging from mild to very spicy.
Eat as much as you want for a fixed price with a selection of meat/seafood and vegetables. Choices could be better - e.g. different meats, veg etc.
Overall, great value, nice surrounding and fun. Was pretty stuffed at the end of it so make sure you have empty stomach to get the most out of it!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2008-12-09,"This place does an unbeatable Sichuan hotpot (or steamboat) for 12.80 Euro for all you can eat. The stocks for the steamboat are pretty authentic although I didn't agree with the peanut dipping sauce too much. There are 3 platters that come with the steamboat, a mix of vegetables and noodles, a mix of fish and cow belly (which is much nicer than it sounds) and a meat platter of chicken, pork, beef and lamb. All of that goes into the hot boiling stocks and then you stuff your face as much as you want. Watch out for the dark Sichuan stock - it's apparently a bit too fiery for some people though it was quite tame for me. It all sounds good but after the second round, it gets a bit same-ish and one can end up rather bloated. But it is still a fun night out and a great economical place to take your friends for an unusual dinner!"
Lucky Star,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2012-09-12,"Was einem am Lucky Star zunдchst auffдllt ist die tolle Inneneinrichtung mit einer Kombination aus chinesischen Elementen und deutschem Stuck die sehr ansprechend wirkt. Als zweites fallen einem die sehr gьnstigen Preise auf. Fьr einen Mittagstisch mit Suppe & Gericht bezahlt man ab 4,90EUR was wirklich sehr gьnstig ist. Die Suppe (Sauer-Scharf-Suppe) war sehr lecker und auf jeden Fall selbst gemacht da sie sich sowohl farblich als auch geschmacklich von den 08/15-Suppen bei den ganzen Vietnamesen unterscheidet. (Die Besitzer des Restaurants kommen alle aus Sьdchina.) Das Hauptgericht (Schwein mit Sellerie in Austernsauce) war vielleicht etwas klein. Was aber angesichts der 4,90EUR und der vorhergegangenen Suppe echt in Ordnung ist. Kurz: ein Lokal dass man zum Mittagstisch uneingeschrдnkt empfehlen kann!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-27,"One of my favorite Chinese place, fast service, staffs who can speak Chinese, English, German and Vietnamese.

Nice food, price acceptable, nice location"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-14,"We have been visiting Good Friends for over ten years now and have never been disappointed by the service or the quality of the food.
The restaurant can be quite overfilled on the weekend so to all the annoyed people out there: reserve yourself a table!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2017-06-28,"Went to Good Friends for lunch and ordered grilled pork, duck and stir fry Choi Sam. The service was good and efficient, unlike some other restaurants with arrogant attitude from the waitresses. Food was tasty though grilled pork is a little too salty. Definitely an authentic Chinese cuisine. Will come back again in the future"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-09-30,"I'm really happy that I could find a good Cantonese restaurant in Berlin,  So far I have tired many different kind of the Chinese cuisine, from different regions in China here. I always wondered if there is a one just for Cantonese. And then passed this place the other day, just couldn't help myself to give it a try. And it was just amazing, really tasted just like what I can have in my hometown. I ordered the most typical and delicious dish from here, the Cantonese roast duck.  It was really good, I enjoyed the meal a lot. Even my friends he wanted it so bad, the only reason he didn't pick it because of it got bones on it. But let's say he was a bit regret it, after he saw my dish. We also ordered some din sums,  the spring roll with shrimp was quite good, my personal favorite is the Har Gow (that is Cantonese, which means dumpling with shrimp). Just give it a try, you might love it. 

I went there with my partner and friends. At the end, we all enjoyed our food really much. The restaurant offers not only traditional Cantonese dishes, but also the westernize dished. So in this case, depend on the guest's mood, surely can find something on the menu. The restaurant is right next to the main street. It's really easy to find. Beside, you can have a peek of the roast duck from the window. Inside the restaurant has a really traditional Chinese style, how it decorated and how the tables set. It could be nice place to get to know some Chinese culture.  The waiters sort of remind me the waiters in Hong Kong, very efficient and don't talk much, but warm inside, if you need anything just ask. The price here is generally alright. When we were there, the restaurant was completely full, we were quite lucky , got a table without waiting. After a while we sat down, the waiting line start to appeared. And it was end until outside the restaurant. That is a good sign for the restaurant.  Just try to reserve a table, if you want to go. Otherwise it will really depend on luck and what time you are going. For me, no doubt, this is one of the great places for Cantonese cuisine in berlin. I will come here. Thumbs up!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-09-18,"One of my favorite restaurants in berlin. 
The food is really good and authentic. 
Good service and great atmosphere. 
Always a pleasure!!!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2017-02-26,"Good tradisonal chinese food, a bit stressome athmosphere. The service could be better..."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2017-03-03,"Visited for the second time today and food was really delicious. First visit went for sweet and sour chicken then on the second visit decided to try fried noodles with beef and I LOVED IT! Also, generous portions. Must try!"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-05-18,"Had a family dinner at Good Friends just now. I was quite impressed by the food. Not bad at all. We are from Southeast Asia and has been traveling for alkost 1 month in Europe. 

We miss asian food and ""Good Friends"" is a good place to satisfied our taste bud"
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-08-05,"Really good chinese food, try some fish dishes. Kind staff. A bit noisy and busy. They had TVs inside the restaurant for the Eurocup and I don't like football :("
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-01-07,"been there many times - and it is always a blast. We had the peking duck yesterday - which is a starter, actually. Even for me, the big eater: excellent."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2014-08-22,"I was here for dinner with two other companions earlier tonight. Since one of them wanted to try out a Chinese place here in Charlottenburg, we opted to start with this place. I placed a reservation earlier in the week, and when we arrived, sure enough, a table was waiting for us.

We ordered several dishes, all to share. We ordered the dimsum platter, as well as a wantan soup for starters. After that, we also ordered the pork belly fried with snow peas, as well as the chicken fried with asparagus. 

I should say that I had better Chinese food somewhere else. Not that this place is bad; in fact, the number of people eating here are enormous, and so they must be doing something good. But I have to say that there are other places that have more spectacular food, and this place just ends up as being okay for me. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would also want to try other places as well.

One tip: there is a difference between the orange part of the menu and the green part of the menu. The orange section is for Germans, while the green section is for those who want to try authentic Cantonese cooking. We only ordered from the green section of the menu, yet it still felt like I was eating Chinese food from the United States. 

Overall, not bad, but not stellar either."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2015-04-22,"I am probably biased, since I am not the best expert when it comes to asian food.

The staff was formally friendly (which is a diplomatic form of saying, a bit stiff on the communication side of things). Yet they were pretty quick, and the food tasted fine.

The pricing is more than fair, and the location is easy to reach with the public transportation system."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-06,Super yummy food and almost authentic like the food you may find in China.There are some pretty exotic cantonese dishes too.I was sitting close to the kitchen and was surprised to see the variety of the dishes they serve.and yes i was totally salivating!
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2016-05-09,Amazing! Nice dim sum. Great main dishes. Good desserts. This is the real Chinese food :) Everything falls perfectly
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2016-01-31,"Waiters are kind, but restaurant looks shabby and the food is the worst we've ever eaten. Nothing more to say."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-06-22,"After the bad experience at another Asian restaurant in Drsden called Good Friends, I'm going to try again with this Chinese restaurant called Good Friends...two times the charm!

We ordered the seaweed tomato fish soup which was seasoned nicely, and the soup was very good. The roasted pork/duck/BBQ pork over Chinese cabbage was moist and juicy..just right. Mom got the beef chow fun noodles, and that was fine. I really liked the fried halibut with black bean sauce ( which was a mistake cause we ordered steamed, so we got the fried fish for free). The clay pot of tofu, cow stomach and vegetables were nicely seasoned. The steamed halibut in light soy sauce was well cooked but I kept getting a mouthful of bones. The shanghai bok choy as fresh and light.

We did good here, I figured if there's enough local Chinese people in this place, then we won't go wrong like yesterday."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-08-09,"Not the best Chinese food in town in my opinion but it's always nice. The service truly is five stars. 
It's always easy to get a table."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-04-04,Best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Very big menu with regular and Cantonese offerings.  Large seating area but it is pretty busy so don't forget to call ahead.
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2013-11-30,"Many long-time Berliners have suggested this place, but to me it's just average greasy-spoon Chinese food--and expensive for what it is.

It is popular though, and finding an open table is a challenge. There must, must be better in this city. I will endeavour to find it and post it here for you! Soon."
Good Friends,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2013-04-16,"You must set expectations here not too high! The Interior is completely outdated, it is loud and crowded! The waiter quickly overloaded and in Streя and forget ever order one or the other.
The food was  partly  good, the fish is unfortunately not quite through. To order a second drink, you have to wait long.
But even so I would have a second chance Good Friends."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2017-12-29,"Very friendly owner and authentic Chinese cuisine.
A cozy, family-style late night restaurant after opera."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2016-04-03,"In general, the food tastes fine, not really impressive but fair. If you want to have ""all you can eat"" hot pot, this place actually I feel much better than another one called Lucky Star which is also located in Berlin near U bahn station- Oranienburger Tor. With similar prices, here there are much more choices, I was surprised that they even offer scampi and mussel! Also more vegetables and the most important things is their stuff is much nicer than another. Here you go to pick whatever you like and as much as you can, but the stuffs at Lucky Star serve for you but always make you wait for long time and bring just a little no matter how many people you have, so I will definitely suggest you to come here rather there."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2014-05-13,Can be a Good choice for the chinese cuisine lovers. I ate a kind of noodle and it was OK. Good location and reasonable price by the way.
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2011-05-24,"To order their speciality-Hot Pot- is experience and food is good.Interier is not charming and service is slowest I ever experienced( for example when fire at HotPot dies and you would like to call service to make it work again...or even order one more drink) ,but otherwise still nice people and dog friendly place."
Nin Hao,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2011-10-14,"Very tasty and reasonably priced.  Cosy, authentic chinese decor and music.  Very large variety of dishes on the menu, but limited beverage list.  Definitely going back!  Would highly recommend when you are craving some high quality chinese food!"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-11-19,"An almost unrecognizable ""hole-in-the-wall"" restaurant, yet serves the most authentic Chinese food in Berlin with dishes from many regions in China including Ningxia.

Try the Grilled Lamb Skewers, the noodle soups, and the Szechuan Beef"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2016-06-26,"Tasty and affordable, though they don't seem to be doing the tabletop bbq anymore, even though it's still on the menu (or maybe that was a temporary thing?). 

Lots of more authentic dishes to separate the menu from the traditional panAsian stir fries made for German palettes. Would definitely recommend the northern Chinese dishes. Skip the dumplings though.

Inside of the restaurant is a little plain. Can be stuffy on hot days. Nice service though."
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-03-29,"This is the first place I've eaten at in Berlin that reminds me of the food back home. I am from San Gabriel Valley in the Los Angeles area where it is easy to find authentic Chinese food so I can say I know my Asian food really well. All the flavors are there. They make their food fresh everyday. The owners and servers are very nice and friendly. And if you want to try something unique, I strongly recommend their red wine pear dish which is cool, crisp, and sweet. They also hand make their noodles and have different dumpling skins that gets its color from vegetable juice. Try this place!"
Fulilai,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-07-13,"Nice dishes, nice services, the dumplings and noodles are very delicious and really 'chinese style'."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2015-10-21,"This is a massive operation; right across the Chinese embassy. On a Wednesday evening, it was packed, with both Chinese and non-Chinese diners inside. There were plenty of Chinese diners; that for me was a good sign.

We decided to stick to ordering little things, and avoiding the main dishes. By the way, the main dishes are huge, so bring an appetite in case you want to order one of those (they come with rice). We ordered the 1000-year-old eggs (we liked it so much we ordered a second one), the spicy tripe, steamed dimsum with pork and vegetables, as well as small servings of the shark fin soup, as well as the sea cucumber soup. We also ordered a pair of non-alcoholic cocktails, simply because their juices looked interesting enough.

Oh, the millennium eggs were great! It looked disgusting, but it melts in your mouth. I loved it. I haven't had it here in Berlin, until now. I was missing it, so it was time to feast on it. 

The spicy tripe was also a great dish. It was not too hot, in my opinion, although I remember them marketing it as rather hot. I guess it's not Szechuan cuisine. Regardless, I loved it.

And finally, the dimsum, which was heavenly.

The soups were interesting, but I should say that the shark fin soup had more hype than taste. I can't say I hate it, but I am not a fan. I guess it is just popular because of its ingredients, but I didn't really see why people make a big deal of it. In my opinion, I found the sea cucumber soup tastier.

Overall, I had a good experience here. I would definitely come back again."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2017-06-03,"It's a reasonably nice place, the waiters were friendly, no problems, the food was... ok. Not great, but ok. The buffet is pretty small and lacks some more sauces (if you offer duck, fish, etc. by itself, I expect more sauces to go with it than just sweet&sour). One meat (I think it was beef) was only lukewarm at best and pretty chewy, which was also true for some of the other stuff. Personally, I would not recommand the buffet, but we will probably go again and try something from the menu."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2015-12-26,People say that it's the best Chinese restaurant in Berlin but I think it might be a bit overrated. There is a big selection of food. Even the most fancy things like shark fins. The menu is very authentic. My boyfriend and I (both from China) decided to have some daily food though. We had Dan Dan Mian (sichuan noodle) and sauer sweet fish. The portion of the sauer sweet fish was not very big. It tastes okay but not so amazing. The noodle was too soft and it was just a bowl of noodle. There should be more meat. The kiwi alcohol free cocktail was disgusting. The staff was friendly though. And the price was okay. Maybe I will try the all you can eat or the more fancy stuff some other day.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2016-06-08,The buffet is huge and full if interesting stuff... Very good for 15 euros..Some of the food are slightly customized to western tastes so that bit is irritating... The dumplings are fresh and tasty...Everything else is quite good and authentic.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2014-07-06,"One of the best Chinease Restaurants in Berlin. They have a huge selection of dishes on the menu, way more that you will find in a lot of other places. The menu is really Chinease with a lot of ""exotic"" dishes like pigs ears, intestines, chicken feet etc. We had some starters and some meat dishes. The portions are really generous and the meat dishes come with rice. I will certainly go back there, great find. 
The location is also nice, you can sit outside and have a direct view on the Spree."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2014-08-21,"I'm Chinese and the food here is awful. The Beef dish was too salty. 
We also got the duck pancake, wow the pancake they used was soggy and not the correct one I rate that ""F"" Bad Bad. 
Close to Potsdamer Platz there is a GOOD duck pancake place Pek-Ente or something.
Dim sum nothing special. Overall, I will NOT return."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2012-04-22,"Real chinese restaurant across the street of the Chinese Embassy. Once, when  I was invited to the 60. Anniversary of the Republic of China Act in the Embassy, this restaurant was the caterer. God food, some of them so authentic, that you are warned by the staff. I highly recommend this restaurant"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2012-07-08,"I gave 2 stars mainly because of the Unfriendly Waiter who made me feel sorry about asking anything,
I assume he's the son of the owner. Unfriendly and somehow rude.
Food is Ok, a bit on the pricey side considering the quality of the food:
We got Half Duck which was good, but the sauce was far too acid.
Rice was good.
Vegetables were ok, but not worthy of 8EUR.
Won ton soup with prawns is too expensive, 5,80EUR for a very small portion,
and taste too much like sesame sauce. 
I tried many chinese restaurants and this one is not gonna be on my list,
def. i won't go back to eat here."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2014-04-12,"This place is amazing! The location is very easy to get to, and the menus have ENGLISH! The english menu made the restaurant quite welcoming and put us at ease when ordering. 

The food itself is quite good, and the service is reasonable by Berlin/European standards."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-04,Authentic Sichuan cuisine. One of the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to when I'm abroad.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2012-12-30,"The mixed review from this restaurant is probably because of its originality and Non Asians, who are used to the cheap Asian noodles around the corner.

The food is typical food of the zhejiang province. They don't do dim sums, so I didn't bother ordering dim sum. I have been here a couple of times already. If you want to experience original zhejiang cooking this is the place and order from the menu. I've tried the buffet, but the quality is not the same."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2012-07-07,"Standing proudly just across from the Chinese Embassy I expected a great deal from this Restaurant. The food was mediocre, the restaurant looks reasonable nice and it's relatively clean. Although I got a dirty knife and a dirty look for asking for a replacement knife. The Mapo Tofu was not like any I'd seen before in my life and there was about 9 grains of mince in the sauce which I know because they were so few I could count them. They have a wide selection of Dim Sum and I had a selection, I was only really satisfied with one of the selections the others tasted like rubber (probably because they were using rubber in the steamers) . I have, unfortunately, no Idea where they got the good reputation they are supposed to have."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2013-07-14,It's hard to find good authentic Chinese Food outside of China.  This place is awesome.
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2012-03-03,"fantastic food. huge selection from many Chinese regions and perfectly done. especially interesting is the dim sum selection  i cant seem to have enough of those and find myself coming back again and again.
the prices are moderate (45EUR for a couple) and the service is very professional.
on Sunday there is a buffet that is boring and not recommended."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2011-08-12,"I've been to the Ming Dynasty I several times, every visit has been a success, good food and good service. The highlight was the the Feuertopf (hot pot) which I shared with a friend one Christmas Eve. Lovely sauces and generous amounts of food. They top up everything as much as required, even the prawns which my friend really tucked into. The tofu was the freshest and the best I can remember having and it was the first time I had the sliced noodles. The peanut/chilii sauce is to die for.
I have also had the buffet for Sunday lunch. This is very good (and good value as well), if not as much a gourmet experience as the hot pot. A good selection of noodles, meat dishes,fish, spring rolls and even some sushi. In particular I enjoyed the crispy duck and the fried prawns/shrimps. The food is continually topped up so things don't run out, even the popular items.
Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in town!"
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2011-02-05,"Great dim sum,tasty wantons(i really love the fried one),to mantion the fried chicken with shenchuan pepper::is a twice fried chicken meet with skin,covered with a mountain of dry chilly.the dish havo no sauce at all and it's very spice.The desserts are bit boring,the usual banana frittes,and ice creams.
Authentic chinese food."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2009-05-29,"Terrific food, with a range of unusual items that one rarely sees in standard Chinese restaurants. No doubt its location right across from the Chinese embassy helps to get the kitchen honest. Certainly worth a visit."
Ming Dynastie,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,5,2008-12-12,"Arguably the best Chinese in town. Good friends is good too and has more roast meats, but Ming Dynasty has a better dim sum and vegetarian menu. The wantons are really really yummy, with a little bit of lemongrass in the stuffing - miam miam. The only negative point is there a very light wine list: there's like 2 reds to choose from and no rosй (which is really de rigueur with Chinese food). Last time I was there I had the 'Great Wall red (produced in China) and it really wasn't that good. The traditional Peking Duck is a must (book 24hrs in advance), as well as the fondue (really popular with their Chinese clientele it seems)."
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-11,Their noodles are honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavors are earthy and sophisticated and the food is super fresh and a lot is made daily like the noodles and broth. The food here has a great mix of textures and flavors that come together perfectly. Their desserts are super amazing too - not too sweet and also very aromatic. Seriously you will not be disappointed!
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-03-10,"This is an amazing place for fans of genuine Chinese (Sichuan) food. Taste and authenticity is the focal point here, and the staff's love for food shines through in all dishes. The ""Ahorn"" noodle dish is recommended!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-06-15,"Probably the best food all along the Brunnenstr. Had tried soups and noodles dishes, and they are all great. It's possible to discover up to 10 different flavors inside a simple baked potato. One of my favorites recently."
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-12-09,The noodles are spectacular. One of the best new additions to the Berlin food scene.
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-02-26,"Elegant, charming ambience. Cozy, intimate and full of beauty. The owners are super nice, make you feel right at home. And the food, oh the food is spectacular! I've been here four times already and it has been consistently good. Just the right balance of flavor, spice and home cooked goodness. Just delicious!"
The Tree,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2016-12-08,"Peaceful ambience. Organic concept. The corner booth cubicals are an enriched idealism that in reality is quite uncomfortable; ambitious cross-leggers may suit these tables. Plating technique was beautiful but heavily lacked in flavor and depth. Service was very kind however, and as it is a new Restaurant it would surely evolve into something spectaular in the future."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2017-08-28,"Really great dumplings here (it seems everyone here orders it). I heard they raised their prices and I did think around А9 is a hefty price for 20 (somewhat small) dumplings but I really did enjoy them and they were very authentic. I also had the kung pao tofu (А10) and it was quite delicious. Overall, the reviews are accurate, I thoroughly enjoyed the food but felt that it was a bit pricey in comparison to other Berlin restaurants."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2016-05-17,"CHEAP. Delicious. Diverse. Flavorful. Plentiful. Homemade. Never Frozen. Authentic. Dumpling. Heaven.

2 Thumbs up & a round, happy Tummy!  Enjoy!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-05-25,"I had this one on my list for a while already but so far it didn't work out but today was the day... 

I love dumplings! No matter whether it's the russians or the chinese but these were quality. Because I wanted to try them all I asked whether it's possible to try them all and when the waitress said ""yes"" without hesitating I was already in love with this place! The menu offers 20 piece or 40 piece options either boiled or fried. We took a mix of everything with 40 pieces and it's just the perfect amount to not be too full while still get a good idea of all their flavours. I loved it and I highly recommend to get a ""mixed platter"" (not on the menu).
Although I loved every single flavor the ones with salmon did stick out today..."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-08-06,"When you have a serious good appetite for dumpling and wish to get a dumpling satisfaction at a reasonable price - then Wok Sho is your place. 

20 dumplings (veg/pork/beef/lamb/sea food) for approx 7-8 euro with an option of boiled/fried.

This is coupled with a variety of Chinese dishes and drinks."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-12-11,This place is very over rated.  We sought it out because we love dumplings and saw good reviews online. We consumed 20 lamb dumplings (below average) and 20 pork dumplings (better but still just average) which we ordered mostly to see if we simply ordered poorly.  I suppose I'd go if I were invited there but I wouldn't go back.  Prices were good at 7.5 Euro for 20 dumplings.  20 dumplings and a beer each will leave you satisfied with enough room for dessert elsewhere.  40 is a lot of dumplings.  One last note - both of our orders were boiled.  Perhaps we should have tried fried dumplings.
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-07-17,"so... the food is really great. Flavourful, rich. The dough could be a little thinner but it's ok. I also like the short menu they have. Unfortunately the service is horrible. We were waiting for them to approach us first to get the menus and then to collect our order for approximately 45 minutes! If it was only depending on me, I would have already left the place, especially that there were only 4 other guests. Another annoying thing was that when we ordered all together 6 plates of dumplings they were serving us only 1-2 plates at a time. I would prefer to be served the whole order at the same time... The prices are also higher than before. Around 7 for 20 cooked sumplings and 8 for the fried ones. I am not sure if I will go back mainly because of the service."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-05-17,"These are the best dumplings that I have found so far. You get a huge order for a very good price and they are very tasty. Try the tofu soup or the cold chicken salad with peanut sauce as well. Very aromatic. I think these are the most authentic dumplings in Prenzlauer Berg. I would further recommend Lecker Song if you prefer something more visually interesting. Forget all the hipster places further south, though. They have no idea how to make a great dumpling serving like what you get in this place."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-07-09,"Just came from it, and yes, sometimes I go all the way from Kreuzberg to Prenzlauer Berg just to eat in there. When I'm in a dumpling mood, oh I love them and They have so many sorts, you can choose, fried or steamed; Let me tell you my favourite one:
Pork and Celery, steamed!

Perfect to go with a group of friends so you can do the full experience as the smaller portion is 20 uni, 40 uni the biggest, so It's good for sharing, combining ingredients and get to know more than just one taste, and they have that wonderful round table with second surface that you can rotate to get someone else's dish ;) friendly people and English speakers. 

Price is just perfect! 
20uni - 6,50А
40uni - 12,50А"
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2016-04-03,"Their dumplings are to die for. The starters are great too, very authentic. I like their tea selection too. The prices are really good even for Berlin. My husband and I usually order starters + dumplings + tea and eat to our hearts' content and the bill is always around 20 EUR. It's a must for people who love chinese dumplings!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-12-29,Very authentic food and definitely good for value. Can get quite busy at dinner time but the food definitely worth the long wait
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2014-11-23,"If you love dumplings and if you want a lot of them, then this place is heaven for you. They offer dumplings with different fillings and you can order either a small or large plate of each taste. The problem is, everything sounds so yummy that you'll always order way more than you can eat. But that's ok, as it tastes just like in China. In addition, the prices are really fair and the service is mostly friendly."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2014-12-25,"Very cozy place specialised in Northern China dumpling. LOVE it! We travelled far for this restaurant, it's all worth the efforts! Very friendly staff and huge portion. Authentic taste, I put my Chinese name against is!"
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-01-02,"The dumplings are real ones, tasty and fresh. I would just wish for a tomato, piece of lettuce or anything colorful as a decoration, because seeing those white dumplings on a white plate without anything else is a bit... sad."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2013-02-08,"Dumplings, Dumplings, Dumplings !!! well done, nice fillings and although made for a small pocket.
Walls locking a little bit strange with all those paints, but ok.
TRY it!!"

Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-03-05,"Been there yesterday for the first time and it's already one of my favorites. Load of dumplings for every taste, probably 12 different fillings or more, steamed or fried (I had lamb and chinese cabbage, fried, very good, thank you!), and very cheap too. Classic chinese beer. And some other stuff too (I had duck and it was delicious)."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2016-05-26,"Had a wonderful party of 15 ppl here. The dumplings are the best in Berlin by far, great for a large group of ppl and the staff was very accomodating."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-02-01,"Fantastic dumplings at a very reasonable price. Pleasant service, a little slow but it can get crowded. I got the fried vegetarian dumplings. Flavorful filling, thin tender wrappers with a great crispy bottom. A number of sauces at the table rounded out the meal."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2013-11-15,"Came here with a friend last Saturday night.  Finally, AUTHENTIC Chinese food in Berlin!

Ordered jasmine tea, 20 cabbage dumplings (steamed), cubed tofu in a delicious sauce (I forget the name) and double pan fried chicken.  Total flavorgasm and I was stuffed afterward!

This place is a must. Be sure to make a reservation, we were rushed out after two hours to make room for people waiting. It was packed."
Wok Show,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2012-11-11,"Lots of average potstickers for an ok price. They are made fresh, which is nice, but it was hard to distinguish between the three different types that we ordered...and that is sorta gross. 

But, if you get off on giant portions, then here you go. You should check this restaurant out. 

That is to say, if you are the type of guy or gal who would say to themselves, ""I like seeing a serving of 60 of these dumplings on one plate and it makes me happy,"" then you will fall in love with this place. 

On a side note:
Why pay extra for frying? Are you trying to keep all the cheap and poor fat people away?

Also, it seems as if only Asian people eat here."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-03-21,The food is exceptional and the service quick/friendly.   We ordered vegetarian food and left quite satisfied.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Be sure to get a reservation on peak nights as the restaurant is usually very busy.
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-11-29,"Originally wanted to try a Korean restaurant nearby but it was fully booked on a Saturday night so we settled for Chinese. The place was pretty full as well so we sat at the bar. We ordered dumpling in Sechuan sauce, steamed halibut and spicy beef stew and finished off with steamed rice balls and sesame ice cream as dessert. All dishes were pretty authentic and tasty but the streamed fish was the standout."
Chi Chi Kan,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-01-16,"A place I could easily visit daily! The food is exceptional , the staff are more than friendly and talkative too! Happy to speak in English as well as German .  I feel extremely welcomed and more than satisfied when I leave . A massive thank you"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-10-28,"A vegetarian / vegan Chinese restaurant? What a cool idea. And very well worked out in this case. The food is good to excellent, the decoration is very nice and the service was great, with a young waiter doing an excellent job. You could see that he was loved by the regulars. 

Our favourite dish was the cauliflower, but the rest was also very nice.

Conclusion: Please open a location in Friedrichshain so we can come often!"
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-02-15,"Good!! Nice interior and food. I go very often even its quite far from my place. They have menu ""suan la tang ???"", its good who loves hot spicy food but time to time its bad... ask for more spicy ver. If u  wanna try gooood suan la tang."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,4,2016-02-09,"We were lazy last night, so instead of cooking, we opted to find some place near our neighborhood to eat. We stumbled upon this place, even though we were walking on our way to some other location, which, perhaps fortunately, had no place for us. So we walked into this one, asked if they had a free table, and voila, we were seated within minutes.

This restaurant is affiliated with the restaurant in our own neighborhood, Tian Fu, and since we knew that was a good choice, I had high hopes for this one. After all, this is quite adventurous: vegetarian and Szechuan. 

Given that there was a vegetarian constraint in this restaurant, I was impressed with the tasty selections they had. There was a section of the menu where they had alternatives: fake duck, fake meat, and so forth, but even if you don't go there, there are plenty of interesting items one can order. 

I simply loved the eggplant Yiuxiang-style. We also ordered a bunch of other appetizers (we're those snobby types that think that appetizers are more interesting than main dishes), and since there were quite a bit of eggplant, we opted to take the remainder home.

I am withholding a star for logistic reasons: there is a section of the restaurant that can only be reached by climbing the stairs. While we were there, someone tripped, and almost crashed on to another table. It would have been great if they installed handrails, or at least made the steps a little bit more visible. The current paint job of very creamy beige doesn't make it too obvious, and people might miscalculate their steps.

Otherwise, this place is great. I'll definitely be back."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2015-03-07,"What a fantastic restaurant. Great service, the food just out of this world. We got treated by the charming owner to a plateful of vegan calamari. OMG! Just amazing. This place is a must try for all you vegetarians/ vegans and spicy food lovers."
Tianfuzius,Vegetarian,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-11-02,"Dear Tianfuzius, Please come to Prenzlauer Berg! We trekked all the way from Prenzlauer Berg to eat here, and boy were we glad we did! We had Xiao Long Bao (Chinese steamed buns), Gebackene Wan Tan mit einer sья-sauren Sauce (fried Wan Tans with sweet and sour sauce), Tofutopf nach Sichuan-Art (Spicy Sichuan Tofu Stew) and Vegetarisches Gongbao Huhn mit Erdnьssen (Vegetarian Gungbao\Kung Po Chicken with peanuts) - every item was delicious to outstanding! My non-vegetarian friend loved the dim sum more than anything and I savoured every interestingly different tasting bite of the tofu stew that left my taste buds in awe! The dim sum portions were small but the entrees were big, especially the stew! The service was nice and the restaurant interiors were lovely. Prices are fair for the quality of the food, portion sizes and location. I highly recommend it!"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2018-01-05,"It's time to face the fact that Lon Men is not the only place that serves killer noodle soup. Shaniu's noodle house is one serious rival in the game of bowls and is not afraid to take the steaming throne.

The noodles are also handmade and the broth is rich and bursting with flavours. Don't be too shy to ask the staff, because the owner is adorable AF."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2018-01-21,"Good quite authentic Chinese food. Great prices, fast service! I'm missing some really good jaozi and bigger vegetable dishes."

ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2016-02-18,"This place has potential but I guess I ordered the wrong thing. It is also not super chinese chinese but rather the lighter, softer less oily korean and japnese inspired chinese food 

I got the beef noodles (??????which was good. The broth tastes like shoyu (soysauce) based which is not something I expect from this dish. Then the noodles are inspired by Japanese ramen.  Well made but still not niu rou mian that I know. 

They have daily special for lunch as well and for thursday it is ???? or aubergine in yuxiang sauce which i was gonna order but i thick the eggplants were a big too thickly cut and looked like deep fried so i didnt order

Might come back later to try the squid with kimchi or the xiaolongbao

Service was great and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean and every dish is made to order by a very nice lady


Also, no tap water ?!?"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2017-04-29,"The light in this restaurant is a bit too bright, but the food they offer is quite ok. Rice can refilled and the meat or squid taste tender! For 104 beef noodle soup, the beef is chewy, noodle could be better and the soup is a bit too salty. And for 35 curry chicken, overall is nice but is actually not so specially which you could have almost the same taste as in other restaurants..."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2014-12-10,"The Beef Noodle Soup is really excellent and tastes just like in China. I have never eaten are more authentic and better Beef Noodle Soup anywhere in Germany. The beef is super tender, sauce has the right flavor and the vegetables are fresh.

Also all other dishes are really tasty. They are very authentic and taste like if you eat at someone's home in China. Therefore the dishes are not super fancy, but it's not needed as they just do everything right at this restaurant.

The restaurant is run by an old Shanghainese man and his wife. They are very welcoming, friendly and do everything they can to make their guests happy. It's one of those places you'll certainly walk out with a smile.

Highly recommending this restaurant. Consider to book a table on Friday nights."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2014-12-15,"After reading serval reviews, my partner and I decided to go to have try it out ourselves. Shaniu's noodle soup restaurant is quite close to the U-Bahn station Spichernstr.. From the station, it took me less 5 mins to find the restaurant. The restaurant itself wasn't so big, but very nice decorated and good atmosphere. 

After we sat down not long later the waiter brought the menu to us. I spent quite awhile just to see what food they offer. Most of them seem very good. But first I would like to try some sea food, so I ordered the seafood noodle soup, Shao Mai and dumplings. 

The seafood noodle soup I ordered was quite nice, very light and it tasted good, I think however it could be better, something was missing in the soup for me. Sadly to say, I have tasted something better in Berlin.  I personally like the dumplings very much, it tasted very special, only if there were bigger I would like it more. Shao Mai was also good. Dishes like this with such as low price, best thing could ever happened. 

After the meals, I started to with the chief a bit. She told me that their kitchen actually mix with Shanghai and Korean style. That was the reason dumplings tasted different, compared with other Chinese restaurants I have been. Some of the noodle soups reminded me the noodle soup from south of China, the looks and the tastes. The service was also really nice and friendly. During the time I was there, I saw quite a lot customers enjoying their meals very much, that was something.

Overall, I like it here, very cool price with delicious food. Although it isn't so close to where I stay, I could see myself come back again."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-04-16,"Super nice service, super nice homemade noodles and their broth is like CRACK!! Totally addicted after the first hit of spicy noodlesoup"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-11-20,"We had a great seafood noodle soup in this place. The slow cooked pork was not that superb (the sauce was a bit to jellylike and the meat quite dry) but the noodles were good.
Price/quality is good, we ate and drank here for 18А total."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-10-26,"This place was a good find thanks to all the yelpers out there. I ordered the beef brisket noodles, bok choi stir fried with shiitake and garlic and chicken with chili oil (was hungry). I was pleasantly surprised on how authentic these dishes tasted having gone to Shanghai a couple of months back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good food. As a added bonus, the staff was very friendly."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-02-10,"On a spontaneous decision, my companion and I went here. I have bookmarked this place already, having read glowing reviews before, so when we were feeling lazy and didn't want to cook at home on a weekday evening, I suggested heading here. 

I should say that it was a good thing that we came in a tad early: we entered at around 19:00 and an hour later, it was packed. I should suggest making a reservation even during the weekday, as I felt like we were simply lucky enough to be early.

I have mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, I loved the appetizers: the marinated pork knuckle was tasty, and the spicy sauce matched it well. The xiaolongbao, while rather diminutive and smaller than other soup dumplings I have had before, was also delicious. 

The soups, on the other hand, were good, but not spectacular. I had the noodle soup with pork belly: the broth was dark and tasty, the meat was good, but the noodles were a little bit too heavy for me. I couldn't see myself being eager and overly excited about this. 

Perhaps I am biased to the Japanese ramen: after all, having lived in Japan, that is my standard of what a noodle soup should be, and perhaps the Chinese variety is just too bland and zurьckgehalten for my taste. There's simply more bells and whistles in the Japanese noodle soup. Hence I am still giving this place 4 stars. The staff after all were great and did everything as they were supposed to be done. And since I haven't been to China yet to evaluate whether they really are doing noodles the way it should be done, then I will give them the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 out of 5."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-04-09,Excellent food. Duck and dumplings excellent. Very friendly waiters and owner. Price ok. I totally recommend.
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2015-11-22,"Last day visiting Berlin from DC. The service was poor. We waited 10minutes to order drinks. People were not pay attention on their customers. However, food came quick once we ordered. The beef noodle soup was fine. But the spicy chicken doesn't has any taste. Too plain. Only chilly oil but doesn't taste any spicy at all. The tofu with black mushroom
 was not good at all. No traditional sweet taste of Shanghai dish at all. Too much soy source on tofu & looked too dark. It's ok food. Clean place. Since it was rated so high, it came out disappointed. Was expected much more!!"
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-01-08,"I have been here 2 or 3 times recently and have to say that it is very good, it's definitely not German-Chinese!!! :-)  I had Gongbao chicken on the daily specials menu, sautйed green beans, beef & bok choy on rice noodles and beef with onions. Most main dishes average 6А but then there are other dishes for ca. 9А (beef with noodles and beef with onions).

The portions are ample and satisfying."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-01-17,"I went here last night, after a very long trek..

I had the gluten cakes (like seitan) with mushrooms, bok choy with garlic sauce, fried veggie dumplings-they were all so delicious! I put tons of the spicy sauce on everything which improved it even more. The dumplings were the best I've had in Europe-small and flavorful with crispy bottoms-try them with the vinegar sauce.

The gluten cakes were really delicious and got better the more I had. The mushrooms were really good. I could have eaten two of those dishes.

Strangely, the worst things we had were the noodles-4 people had them at my table and 3 reported their soup/fried noodles were bland. The noodles themselves were good but the dishes they were in were overall ok.  I would recommend getting lots of the small dishes or vegetable dishes, my meal was perfect but those who got the noodles and not appetizers were a bit disappointed.

Would definitely go back though! The staff were also extremely nice."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2015-08-24,"Cozy little place that serves real Chinese food: we tried the beef noodle soup, fried eggplants w pork wrapped inside, and beef w/ broccoli. All tasted super! & the boss is super nice!!"

I'm Chinese and everything we had was very authentic tasting. Very reasonably priced and delicious. Both my kids loved their food as well. We had 3 different types of noodle soups. We tried duck, beef, and pork belly...all were very good. Also the pan fried pork dumplings were excellent. Easy walk from our hotel on Augsburg Str. Large menu with many choices. Highly recommend."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2014-08-22,"Very tasty, and they have the soup-filled dumplings I've been looking for!  Handful of tables in Wilmersdorf, but a nice, clean eating area -- a big step up from your standard Asia Box, with competitive prices.  Menu is split between dim sum-style starters and various noodle dishes, stir fries, and soups.  The house-made noodles were packed full of gluten-y yumminess, and the dumplings were fresh and tender.  Will definitely make this a regular stop when we're looking for Chinese food."
ShaniuТs House of Noodles,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2014-10-22,I agree that their dumplings are good. But I can't agree that their soups are all that great. Was a little disappointed frankly especially after reading all the great reviews here.

China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2010-10-26,"So, after wandering about the Soviet-inspired city-planning horror that is Karl Marx Allee, I was hungry and needed a good meal... and on a cold and rainy Saturday, with the streets almost empty, I ventured into this welcoming spot.

Unexpectedly, a menu in English appeared, the owner was more than accommodating in getting me a glass of water (with ICE!) they he didn't bill me for! The build out is top notch - comfortable and decorous, without being schmaltzy like some asian places.

I ordered a sublime sweet and sour chicken - a meal that was simply perfect in so many ways.... and, honestly, a portion I should hav shared with someone else, but greedily ate most of it. Nice touch: The plate is served on a small pedestal that holds a candle to keep it warm as you dine. It looks great and actually works.

For many cities, this place would probably get 4 stars, but here in Berlin - they get 5 for the extras."
China Restaurant HuaTing,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2017-05-24,"First off, loved all the fish tanks that this restaurant had. The food was very good and filling. The portion sizes were really good for the price. I went with some friends so we were able to pick and choose a ton of dishes and split everything. Worked out to be a high quality dinner that also gave each of us a variety of food."

Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-05-24,"This food is delicious! Never heard of such a place before, but was simply walking by as I had to wait an hour for my appointment at the Zullasungstelle down the street. Walked in, met a very friendly staff that recommended me the Beef dumplings, and I also ordered the pumpkin/pea dumplings. I'm literally just through the pumpkin/pea dumplings right now and realized I had to write in Yelp asap about these guys. 

In the picture is the beef dumplings only (b9 on the menu I believe) as I was starving and chomped on the pumpkin/pea set immediately. Highly recommended and I'll be back here even without an appointment at the Zulassungstelle! :-)"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under А10,4,2017-08-27,"Set in a beautiful part of the Kreuzberg area called Bergmannkiez, this neighborhood eatery provides delicious dumplings and relaxing atmosphere. Whether you decide to sit outside on the street and watch the passers by or inside, you'll surely enjoy anyone of Cha for Tee's broad menu of meat-filled and vegetarian dumplings.

I went with an appetizer of pork wanton soup, which really hit the spot. Later, I hit the pork dumplings with cabbage and coriander. It was quite good--not the best dumplings I've ever had--but definitely satisfying enough and well worth the price.

But the real piece de resistance of the joint is the desert. I got the pastry dumplings (set of two) which came I are with coffee out on the street-side tables.

All and all, it was a perfect way to spend a late Sunday afternoon."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under А10,4,2017-10-17,"The place is in a very cute area~there are many different kinds of dumplings here, and they are colorful! Good dumplings!"
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under А10,3,2017-07-26,"If you are craving dumplings or some semblance of Chinese food, this place is fine. They have a homemade chili oil sauce that I liked. The dan dan mian was tasty, but it lacked the boldness that I am used to. Xiao long bao was a disappointment --flavor was decent, but most of my soup dumplings didn't have soup. Ma la ro was acceptable.

If this is your only option for Chinese, you'll be fine. Good service, nice ambiance and plenty of seating on a quiet street near templehof. It was a very pleasant experience nonetheless. CASH ONLY."
Cha for Tee,Dim Sum,4.0,Under А10,5,2016-11-07,"This place is so cute. And super tasty. We tried the green bean appetizer and several of the vegetarian and pork dumplings. All are highly recommended- especially the green beans. The tea selection was crazy. The only draw-back was that the dumplings take a while to steam. We ordered another round after our first and then one more for dessert and ended up staying quite a while, even for European standards. But the atmosphere is nice so no real complaints here!"
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-11-04,"It's difficult to find a good dimsum place in Berlin. Not only are they usually pricy, but they're also not as tasty as what you'd find in the US or UK (outside of China of course).

This little jem is a great find. They really meant it when they say hausgemacht, they're true to their word: fresh homemade dimsum! It took a bit of time to get our meals, but it was worth the wait; it's also how you know they're actually made fresh. And the cost is reasonable (I wouldn't say cheap - it's Europe after all).

We had just the basics: har gaw, siu mai, and char siu bao - just a quick stop. We're definitely coming back to try the other items."
The Flying Monkey,Dim Sum,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-08-13,"One of the best Asian cuisines we have ever been to. We ordered family style and nothing remained on the table at the end. Highly recommend this place, our first real stop in Berlin! The location is in a great area, much happening here."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-10-27,"Very inexpensive + fresh and flavorful = five stars.

Found this place walking through Alexanderplatz. Menu and prices looked good, so we gave it a shot. So glad we did! Prices are А5-А8 for carry out to dine in, the portions are sizeable (we were hungry after a day of walking!) and the food is cooked fresh and fast while you wait. Great sauces, crisp veggies, nicely cooked meats. For this price you can't do better."
anan,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2016-04-27,"Look, let me start by saying that, despite more good places popping up as of late, it can be really hard to find good Thai/Chinese/Eastern Asian type food, so it's all relative. So I am rating this place not on a grand scale of Asian food in Berlin, or even compared to the stuff I miss from the US, but relative to other Asian and specifically fast food places in Berlin.

As far as quick eats Asian places, this is about as good as you'll find. А4.50 will get you a box with lots of rice, veggies, and chicken (А1 more for duck) and your choice of decent sauces. After trying every other place around there this is the only place in this category that I have ever come back too, and now I come two or three times a week. Generally, avoid Alexanderplatz as all of the food around is garbage, but if you are there all of the time (I work one tram stop away, and food is worse by my office) and need a decent quick meal, this place is pretty solid."
Green Flavor,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2017-05-31,Good service and even better food. I had the wontons in chili oil to start. And then the noodles with pork and shrimp and vegetables. Was fantastic.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-02-06,"My favorite meal in Berlin! Very affordable, and very tasty. 

Kind staff, quick service, lovely atmosphere.

Entrees: #52, crispy duck, is to die for. 
veggie/vegan: many options, my friend got fried tofu with noodles and said it was great

Appetizers: fried wontons are AMAZING (not huge portions, so if you're hungry get a few...they're only a few euros). The vegetarian spring rolls are also great."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2017-02-04,Nothing was tasty. The lime chicken was inedible; the meat felt like it's been boiled dry. The gado gado wasn't a gado gado; there was frozen boiled carrots and peas in it.. . Everything tastes like cheap sauces from the Asia shelf at the supermarket. Nothing is fresh.

I honestly didn't have so many expectations looking at the price of the food which is relative cheap, but the dishes were simply well done, good quantity, delicious taste and pretty good varieties of choices

I took a chicken dish with Sumatra sauce with peppers, my friend took the duck. The chicken was well cooked the spicy was balanced the coconut sauce was not covering everything like sometimes happens with this kitchen type; the duck crispy and the side dish was made up of vegetables and a little sweet sauce

I think the fortune of this place at the moment is the a capable chef. You could cut the chicken with the fork

The place inside is nice; there is also a more elevate space for a couple of tables in the end of the room

I'm sure I will be back here

UPDATE 19/09/2015
Since I recently found this place I've been here 3 times (please don't go to imbiss so frequently!), trying different dishes, always with an excellent service"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2017-08-10,"This place used to be so good. Now the service is very poor, and the dishes bad quality. I used to come here all the time, but now I find there are much better places in this area. i have a pet peeve for restaurants living off of ""former glory"" and getting worse in service and quality.sadness."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2016-06-12,"Very good value! Cheap price and tasty food. Cozy restaurant, veeeery friendly waiters! The two of us ordered the snack plate as a starter, the black dragon and 4 small bowls (spicy fish, Sumatra tofu, rice and mango salad) as a main. Everything was delicious (especially the snack plate, sumatra tofu and black dragon). Good portion size! 
Will be back for sure :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-11-21,"Absolutely loved this place. First off, we were sat right away, which is a good start. We did come on a Saturday, and it was fairly busy. I love that you have the option of ordering smaller, sample sized portions. It gives you the opportunity to try multiple dishes if you can't decide on what you want. We decided to start with Gado Gado, and (two) fried pork dumplings. This was my first time trying Gado Gado, and though I am not usually a fan of tofu, I really enjoyed it! And for only 3 Euros, it was definitely worth it. The dumplings were also great. I liked that they were pan friend, rather than deep fried. For mains, we ordered the Peanut Duck and the Lime Chicken. Both were delicious. Good presentation as well. My one complaint would be that the duck was slightly overcooked, which made it a bit chewy.  

Overall, the food was very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I am excited to go back, and next time, try a couple more dishes out."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2013-07-09,"Given the name of this restaurant, I am sure that plenty of people have come here to have a juvenile moment. Anyway, my companion and I tried this one evening, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all, I have this idea that as Berlin has plenty of Asian restaurants, it cannot be the case that all of them are good. So perhaps there are more bad restaurants than good ones. This is coming from someone who is still surprised to see Thai and Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine in one roof.

Anyway, like I said, our food was rather good. And given the price, I expected something bare-bones, but what we got were rather swanky. I ordered the Sumatra duck, and it was said to be rather spicy. Beware of the red chilli peppers; they really are hot. My companion ordered the spicy duck, which was more a hot and sour sauce. Both came with rice. And we washed it both with iced ginger tea. 

Overall, I think it was a good choice. I'd be more than willing to go back here again when I have the chance."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-06-15,Ordered the normal chicken nudles and the duck with black pepper sauce&rice and couldn't decide which one was better. Also the service was great!
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,1,2016-06-24,"This place is terrible. Why did I believe the yelp reviews? The food is not fresh nor good quality and is masked in pre-mixed sauces, over fried in old oil and served in small cheap portions - reflecting the quality. The chicken looked as though it was breed on hormones and pumped with water and starch. I don't usually bother to write bad reviews but I feel stupid for going here and want to warn others against it. Tourist trap. Bad."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-10-07,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT!

Best food, friendliest stuff, beautiful atmosphere, fair prices...always.

Try the chicken satay, the chicken wings, black dragon, the mango salad or peanut tofu... all at once! (there is an option to try several dishes in smaller bowls instead of only ordering one big one) 

Anyway, enjoy! :)"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,3,2014-11-02,"Aside from the creepy, questionably non-PC name, this place was aight. I like that in the menu, they specify what is in all of the sauces they use, since usually in an Indonesian or similar restaurant, I am not too familiar with the types of sauces they have. Other than that, I didn't think this restaurant offered anything too unique. The food was just ok and will do if you are craving Indonesian food. Service was again, just ok. The atmosphere was comfortable, but I honestly am not that convinced to come back again."
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-02-06,"Amazing, this place was so cute and so good.Service was great and the courses were large. Note-if you take a rice table which is cool because you can share, the plates are really small..so if you are on a budget go for the bigger plates.. Would really recommend for a nice night out with good food..Have been there twice and I really think you can't go wrong...Delish!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-01-01,"Service & Atmosphere: Very friendly and prompt service. I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don't have to wait long for food

Food: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! 

Drinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.

Price: I don't know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each? Which is great if you want to try a lot of things and works out to be a similar price as a main!

In short: Definitely recommend this place!!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2016-02-22,A great find on a rainy night. Delicious food with authentic flavours for the right price. Very friendly and quick service.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,2,2014-11-30,"Average, didn't know how it deserved the 4.5 stars. We all ordered different dishes with entrйe and from five people had no positive feedback. Give it a miss"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2015-01-17,We tried the vegetarian food and it was really good. I had the tastiest Tofus ever and I will definitely come again.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,5,2014-07-23,"The food here was completely delicious, we were able to share a few small options between 3 of us, very tasty. The drinks are reasonably prices, and the atmosphere and service was very good!"
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2014-04-13,We really liked this place. The atmosphere was great. The waiter very friendly. The prices were good and the appetizers out of this world.
Rice Queen,Chinese,4.5,Under А10,4,2010-08-12,Good Indonesian food here. I tried the rijsttafel (rice table) and it was very good. Lots choices to mix and match with just the right amount of spice. Prices are very reasonable to boot.
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2018-02-04,I liked the location. It's really important to. Friendly stuff. Delicious food with long menu of beverages.
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,3,2017-07-11,"I walked up to the counter and asked where I should sit. I was told anywhere. I chose a table outside it the public area but just outside the restaurant. It is their area as well. It took a very long time get my order taken. The wonton soup was good. It is broth, mushrooms, green onion, and wontons. I ordered the Kong Pow Chicken and the double fried pork with sweet and sour sauce. It came with white rice. All the food had a good toast. Not the best but not the worst. The service really hurt their score. I almost walked out waiting. The value is good for the money."
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2011-04-25,"I think we must have picked the wrong time of day to visit this restaurant. We went quite late at night and it was busy but the food was nothing like the reviewer's on qype raved about nor like the pictures.

The restaurant is quite out dated and looks like it needs a make over but i hoped that the food would be at least worth it which I'm afraid for the price it was a big let down. 

Bf ordered king crab cocktail which was А10 to which the waiter said they had none but could make it with prawns for him so we thought he would deduct the price a bit since it wasn't what he originally wanted. When the bill came they had charged the full А10 and it was a tiny amount he got. They also served his starter before mine so i had to wait 10mins wondering if mine was going to arrive.

Main courses were ok but nothing special and if anything they were far too salty. The portion sizes were huge though and can't complain about that but definitely share one as we couldn't finish ours. The main complaint for us was the final price А50 it was just not worth that for what we got and the waiters made no interaction with us apart from asking what we wanted to order. Felt like we were ripped off. So we won't head back there when in Berlin again."
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2011-08-04,"Been there twice for lunch already and it's really not bad at all for a Chinese in Berlin. Both times I had the business lunch deal at EUR6 to EUR7.50 where you get a small soup (hot sour or veggie) or a springroll, and then a rather big choice of mains. It's a really good deal. I've had the roast pork with a spicy sauce (not spicy at all but maybe for a German), which was the traditional Chinese red porc in a sweet soya sauce and then some really yummy fried rice (at everything in it), which I find really hard to get here. 

Today, I ate the veal in a Chinese curry sauce and that tasted pretty authentic too. If you want to go for dinner the а la carte menu is varied but not too much (meaning that the food is fresh) and they have a fairly good selection of wines. 

The decor is extremely 70s Kung Fu movie."
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,2,2012-07-14,"I must admit I am generally not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but when my friend had a Chinese friend in town, I figured I'd go. Even though the whole ""it's proper Chinese"" is more scary than exciting to me (I lived in San Francisco and have had proper Chinese food). Luckly, the majority of what they offer is ""western"" meat, mainly pork. The dim sum menu is good, but I think too small and they serve all the dishes at once rather than after another, so some get cold - not so yummy. But all in all I thought the dishes were bland and lacked flavor (but I often think that of Chinese food) and for me there is always too much sauce. The Chinese freind was also not too impressed. I am sure there are better Chinese places in Berlin."
China Restaurant MingТs Garden,Chinese,3.5,А11-20,4,2007-11-18,"Ming's Garden is really located in the Marburger Straяe and is in easy walking distance to the KaDeWe.


 This restaurant is chinese by heart! You never have the impression that some of the interior is a fake. The restaurant is lovingly decorated.


 The dishes were all good and well prepared. Someone who likes it really hot wouldn't choose a chinese restaurant anyway. ;-)


 The waiters are confirming the ""preconception"" of chinese friendlyness. :-)


 With regard to price Ming's Garden is slightly above the average. But the good quality of the meals justifies this!"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-10-17,"Now this doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has really good quality tasting Chinese food.  I brought my friend who lived in China for 5 years here, and he said it was the first time in a long while he's had a flashback of his days in China while eating the food.   On a side note, the waitress was very friendly."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,3,2015-10-26,"It doesn't look like that but this place serves pretty authentic chinese dishes BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RED MENU CARD NOT THE PAPER ONE. I REPEAT RED!!

Because that's where the good stuff is.

I have been here twice one time I made the mistake and didn't followed the instruction and just ordered what was on the boards. (The food was meh)
After asking a fellow foodie I found out what to do:
You go inside and act as of you are fully aware of how this shit works like really confident and SIT DOWN. Don't go to the desks. May be don't smile. Just be very confident. If you look cool enough they'll bring you the red menu and you scored. This time the food was nice although I accidently ordered something with meat. The menu is totally random and has no specific order. But remember: You are aware of all that!

I had the pak choi with steamed egg (filled with meat as I found out) and hacao (which are filled with chicken and shrimps instead of shrimps only). Was still good.

Staff is ... Well it feels like this place is the god damn Berghain among cheap Asian venues. They don't smile and are not friendly but not rude either. It's weird."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,5,2017-02-11,"This is straight-up some of the best Chinese food in Berlin. The outside can be severely misleading and the staff barely speaks German, which pays homage to the authenticity of the joint. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves tasty Chinese food!"
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2016-11-04,"One of the best tasting Chinese restaurants I've been to. Do not let the ""Imbiss""-style store front scare you off, this place is awesome. Make sure you get the red menu, that's where the great food is and go for all the specialities."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,2,2014-03-31,"Based on the reviews, I tried this place the other day. I also felt much better when I walked in and there were a number of Chinese people eating there... I ordered a beef with peanut sauce dish. It was just okay, I've experienced  much better but the price was about 5А..."
Asia Deli,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2011-07-27,"This place doesn't look like much outside or inside but it's actually really good. Great price and good taste.
The old chef was a real master, some of the best Chinese food I ever had, but sadly moved back to China in 2010, the new chefs are getting better all the time though, not quite up to the old standard yet
Choose from the menu, not the set plates on the board, much better food."
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-07-24,"Great food! Really nice staff, the waitress gave my boyfriend and I free fortified wine at the end.

One thing- yelp says it is 4 euro signs when it is SO CHEAP! Like, 5 euros for an entree and a side cheap. Please change this yelp!"
China-Restaurant Fu Long,Chinese,4.0,Under А10,4,2015-07-24,"This is the place for good Chinese food at low prices. They even gave us the lunch special price at dinnertime, and complimentary after-dinner drinks. Knocked my socks off. I would say to you: go for it. Go. Tasty stuff."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2012-07-17,"This place was recommended by the place we're staying and it was an excellent recommendation.  It is more of a fusion place than a traditional Asian resturant.  So while in yelp it is called ""Chinese"" you won't be finding mapo tofu or other traditional things or even bad western-fied things.

The dishes all have creative names and interesting references.  They should have a contest about them!  There are yummy starters like the pumpkin soup with shrimp (The shrimp are amazing by the way). Or fried dumplings (they call them dim sum, but don't expect and carts here,) on what appears to be either melted ice cream or yogurt.  Something bizarre that shouldn't be good but is!  I also tried the seven minutes of pleasure, which is almost large enough for a main, that evokes memories pleasant memories and good taste sensations.

The mains are also just as creative and interesting.  Like spicy chicken with Szechuan pepper.  While it doesn't have a lot of that lovely/deadly/numbing ingredient it is there, so points for them.  The beef with sweet potato is amazing as well as the shrimp dish whose name I can't remember.  but it is served with a mango and tomato side that is very well done.  All the mains we've tried are creative and cooked perfectly with good skill.  

A tip, get the ""best"" house wine, it is a very nice tempranillo and priced nicely.  the service is attentive and friendly.  Small, so get there early.  

Really, I feel this place is four and  half stars, but the disco bathroom buts it over the top!!!"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2015-09-06,"Very artisticly decorated place probably great for small eats and drinking. Dishes are created with thoughts and named impressively and associated with Chinese artists: CHUNG KING EXPRESS, named after the same movie, WANTEN WITH CHICKEN AND PRAWNS SERVED IN HOT SOUP.  GONGLIіS BOAT (named after internationally renowned movie star??) it's FRIED DIM SUM WITH PRAWNS AND CORIANDER CREAM. And MULAN MILAN VERSUS SHE-RIMP. So you get the idea

The interesting appetizer I ordered was †DEEP THROAT AVOCADO: KING PRAWNS WITH AVOCADO ON RICECAKE WITH MAYONNAISE AND WASABI. The visual delivery is fine.  However the favor doesn't come up to the uniqueness of the ingredient choice. It's a bit dry due to the rice cake,  even the moisture from avocado and wasabi paste didn't help. 

Overall, the food is not bad. They are trying hard.  I may go back again to try BRUCE LEE,  OX CHEEKS SALAT IN FINE STRIPES WITH APPLE CUCUMBER AND THICKNESS VINEGAR MARINADE. Or just have a drink in their trendy dining lounge."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2016-04-30,"Went to Toca Rouge for the first time today.

food gets 3 stars.
Service gets 2 stars at most. Stressed out with no reason (the place was empty as we came in) 

The place where they have so much customers through tourists that they just dont care if ppl are feeling welcome at all. 

And after paying the bill you only leave tip coz ""you kind of have to"" and go out disapointed"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2014-07-01,"I expected chinese food.its not at all.... ordered pekingduck,pumpkin soup,something lip(sichuan spicy), lamb something. Taste is not bad not good. 

Its fusion food that  taste ok.
Pumpkin soup was good. 
Peking duck roll was soso. 
Main dishes was all soso. 

Maybe i expected too much.. 
I love chinese food and i lived about 10 years there.
And if this restaurant is in china. Will close very soon.
But maybe good taste for german.

But my.germam friend said:
Good atmosphere, nice price, good starter
Soso maindish."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2014-03-22,"It may have been the positive reviews that raised my expectations, but I found the whole experience to be pretty average.

I arrived on a Wednesday night and it was packed, elbow to elbow. I don't really mind that (I'm pretty used to small spaces and quite a lot of chatter around me). This is just a note to the people thinking of dining here, that regardless of the day of the week, you may or may not get a table unless you have a reservation.

The service here is okay. Nothing spectacular, and there was a bit of a mix-up where a beer my friend ordered went to the table next to us, but hey, things happen.

I guess the thing that just left me bored was the food. The rice cake soup (Green White Pool) we ordered was kind of bland and salty. My pork entree with the goji berries (Yasming Dynasty) was okay. The mango salsa that it came with was tasty but the pork was a bit too chewy and the goji berries didn't actually enhance the flavor as much as I wish it had. My friend's fish (Mao's Darling) was also bland but somehow compensated by the salty sauce. I wish it was a bit more balanced. The dessert (Sticky Orange Love Pudding) was good but I felt could be recreated at home after a trip to the Asian supermarket.

I did enjoy the disco lights and the random hip hop playing in the bathroom though. 

Overall, nothing wrong with this establishment. If I do end up going back sometime, I'll try some of the other dishes and see how they are. It just wasn't a wow experience for me."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2014-08-02,"Toca Rouge is classy.
The restaurant is intimate with its dark decor, stylish, the food is well presented, and the pricing is perfect for what you get. I always order the same thing when I go - The Red Honey Blonde I think it is called. It is a beef and sweet potatoes dish. I am in love with this dish. My girlfriends ordered an array of appetizers and they were all delic.! The only thing they could work on is the staff. The waitresses could smile or be a bit more engaging. I find myself returning again and again to Toca Rouge since it is delic., fresh, flavorful, unique, and a great place to meet up with a very small group of friends or have a romantic dinner."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2015-08-03,Came here after we couldn't get a table next door. W. O. W. It was amazingly good. Such interesting flavours. Must return to try more of the menu. We had the beef with sweet potato which was my favourite and the duck. Terrific Riesling as well.
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2011-09-04,"In coming to a foreign land, even one as close to the UK as Germany, you kind of feel a bit stupid for going to the kind of restaurant you'd get at home. We ummed and ahhed over the idea of getting Chinese food in Berlin, wondering, what *is* the German view on this type of cuisine? How will it taste? Are we running a risk?

Pah! One look at the menu which resembles the opening credits of the Star Wars movies and we were convinced this was the right place to eat. And I can safely say this was like no Chinese food we'd ever experienced before. An ice cold Tsingtao and a plate of veggie dumplings, steamed pak choi and sticky rice, consumed alfresco on a balmy Berlin evening... I was happy indeed. The sauce was fragrant, the pak choi not soggy in the slightest and the dumplings themselves were tender, crisp around the edges and packed to the rafters with greens and fresh delicious veg. This felt wholesome and indulgent at the same time, and that's not an easy combo to achieve.

Unfortunately, we didn't do what we were supposed to do and check out the disco bathroom with its unnerving and entertaining flashing coloured lights. I can't believe we forgot about that! Oh well, looks like another trip over to Germany's in order then..."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2015-10-20,Very special atmosphere and delicious food. I have been here a couple of times and never got disappointed. The service is good and attentive. I would not recommend this place to big groups as it is a small restaurant. Group of four is good though. Loved the banana dessert cake.
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,3,2014-06-19,"Meh. 

This place is a gimmick, from the decor, through the dish names and all the way to the toilet. 

The food itself was decent, nothing special. Reasonably priced, but they seem to be repeating themselves with different dishes having the same sidings and garnish. 

The mood is very modernish and hip, but as far as eating goes, you'd enjoy one of the simpler Vietnamese places in Mitte much better."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2013-07-14,"Nice! 
Funny menu w/ Asian fusion dishes. They combine traditional cooking w/ new and surprising ideas and fresh herbs.
Go there, but make a reservation. It's always crowded!
And: don't forgot to visit the restroom before you leave ;-)"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2012-11-30,"Great food for fair prices. I had the green soup and the black  honey hot girl beef on sweet potatoes. Delicious. I loved the interior design. Make sure to go and have a look at the bathroom. ;)

Downside: no WiFi."

unfortunately, the restaurant is not huge, so it's good to have a reservation"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2013-03-04,"A hip little Asian fusion restaurant and interesting variations on Asian dishes. My favorite item on the menu is Bailing's Lips which is a spicy chicken and vegetable rice dish. The dim sum appetizer is also a favorite item that I order when ever I go there. The young wait staff is excellent and attentive. My only complaints about the place is that it can be noisy and the seating is often a little cramped. The little wooden stools that everyone sits on aren't that comfortable and are always falling over when people rise from their seats. But all things considered,  I really like this place and go there often. The decor is very dark and the lighting is intimate in a modern way. As many others have said check out the bathroom. You won't regret it."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2013-04-12,"I finally made it. I have been wanting to go here for some time! I never new that they were open for lunch, so when I found out, I took my chance. The lunch dishes are all around А7 and the portions are pretty big. Looking at the menu, the staff seems to have a healthy sense of humor, always appreciated :D The food was served quickly and was delicious. The only reason I am subtracting a star is because the food is quite greasy, but good! Go!"
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,4,2013-04-02,"I really liked my dinner here. I'd walk or take a short ride on public transit to eat here again. I ordered a vegetarian ""un-duck-cover"" dish which was very flavorful, a little sweet, a little sour, but not greasy. The prices were not high, but the value was not exceptionally good, as the portion size was not very large. The low light and funky decor created a kind of nightclub atmosphere.
English menu and English-speaking staff."
Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,5,2009-10-04,"Best asian food I had so far in Berlin. The names of the meals are fancy, and the dishes are excellent. Modern Asian dishes, very tasty.

Toca Rouge,Chinese,4.0,А11-20,2,2012-11-22,"Den Begeisterungsstьrmen auf Qype folgend haben wir kьrzlich das Toca Rouge getestet, aber meine Bewertung fдllt etwas bescheidener aus.
Ja, die Einrichtung ist hip und cool. Alles in schwarz und ziemlich dunkel, jeder Tisch hat nur eine lдngliche Taschenlampe als Spotlightbeleuchtung  sicherlich Geschmackssache, aber ich fand's ganz gut. Dennoch stehen die Tische seeeehr eng beieinander, sodass ich fast bei meinem (fremden) Nachbarn auf dem Schoя saя. Die Bдnke an der Wand sehen bequem aus, sind aber kein bisschen gepolstert, daher bin ich nach 1-2 Stunden ziemlich verspannt wieder aufgestanden.
Die Bedienung ist freundlich, manchmal sogar eher etwas zu zurьckhaltend, und die Karte (4-5 ausgedruckte DIN-A4-Seiten, die zusammengetackert wurden  ist wohl auch hip) tatsдchlich etwas abgegriffen.
Ich entschied mich fьr Hьhnchen in Orangensoяe mit Wasserspinat und natьrlich Reis. Die Hьhnchenstreifen waren wirklich lecker paniert, allerdings hдtte man fьr 8.90 Euro auch besseres Fleisch verwenden kцnnen! Ich musste leider ein paar Knorpel oder fettige Stellen aussortieren  sehr дrgerlich und auch anstrengend wдhrend des Essens, wenn man nicht weiя, ob der nдchste Bissen gut werden wьrde. Die Soяe war ganz gut, der Reis auch. Der Wasserspinat machte allerdings eher einen Anschein von Pok Choi, war sehr schwierig zu kauen und blieb dauernd unangenehm im Hals stecken.
Fьr das Geld und den Hype hдtte ich mehr erwartet  schade!"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,5,2016-04-27,"I was looking for some nice place for nice buffet in Berlin, this one pop up. So I decided to pick weekend come here to have a try. The Royal Garden is a bit far from the city center. luckily, they are not so far from the S-Bahn station. It takes about 10 minutes to get to this place from the station on foot. For me, was 30 minutes around got to this place. My firest impression this place after I walked in. I really like how the restuarant looks like. It just got this very traditional and cultural of China in. the nice decoration just made the atmosphere of the whole place even better. It was very classy at the same time. The place was quite full when I was here, well, probably because it was weekend. That was the reason, I have called them before and made a reservation. It didn't take long, to find the table. And the staff come to us really fast. I did find it a bit funny that they only brought us one menu, when we gotlike 10 people. Anyway, we just came for the buffet, so it wasn't a big deal. I check thier cocktails menu and tried the drink. the price of the drinks were alright. the taste was of the cocktail Zombie I ordered was fine.

About the buffet, they just looked amazing. one side was the food which already cooked and the other side was the food that not cook yet which people allowed that choose the way they wanted to be done. And the cold dishes like sushi and vergatables. They offered quite a lot options and good one. I found most of the food tasted great. I was so full after couple dishes. They also got an Icecream machine, which to be honest, I didn't really like the icecream. it just full of water and tasted just alright. I also didn't find watermelon at the fruit section. it was kind pity. 

At the end, I do think it is worth to come here to have a nice meal, even this place wasn't that close to city center. I think, for a big group of people will be a great choice, so everyone could find something they could eat."

Longer version (for the brave) - I'll be honest, you'll never find me in this part of town unless there's a special occasion, and there was! A bday of a fellow yelper (and a friend) is a reason for a feast.

I was first to arrive, and the staff looked at me and examined me constantly which made me feel uncomfortable, but when everybody else joined it was okay 
The place itself was crowded and every table was full, the minute somebody left, another group came almost instantly 

We ordered some cocktails and headed over to the Buffett, and that's exactly what I have in mind when I hear this word.
Thing is massive! 

For 18А there's an endless option all you can Buffett - from simple salads to many grill options, you can make a mix grilled diy plate (choose from seafood, fish, beef, lamb, chicken and even kangaroo!)  or you can take some from the rodizio grill.
And if that's not enough there are plenty of other main dishes- I've tried a little from almost everything, curry, different Chinese dishes, fried rice, regular rice, soups and deep fried fruits.
Dessert? No worries! There's soft ice cream and various cakes to choose from! 

I wasn't expecting much from a place outside of town, but the quality of the food was very good! Everything I tried tasted fresh and there's a reason why I had four plates ;) 

If you are around and starving, I'd pass by"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2013-10-19,"My companion and I went here for dinner the other night. There was supposed to be another companion, but she canceled at the last minute. Anyway, the two of us went to the southern part of the city to check this place out. I heard good things, and I was willing to try something new.

Anyway, I was surprised at this Chinese restaurant. It is huge. There is a huge statue at the door way. There is a floor aquarium with carp swimming. There is a chariot right at the middle of the room. It was all quite theatrical.

Oh well, we weren't there for theatre, but we were there for the food. I was about to order something from the menu, but it seems that everyone here goes for the buffet. I am not typically a fan of buffets, wanting more quality than quantity, but when in Rome...

So I went. I started with the soup. The soup was good. There were two choices, but I tried just the sour and spicy one. I also tried several dishes, and they even have a grill, where you pick up the meat you want, and put it on the counter for the person to grill it for you. It was all very elaborate. 

Anyway, the buffet costs 15,90 EUR plus drinks. Again, I rarely go to buffets, and I felt like a plump overfed pig afterwards. I have to say, the buffet choices were good. But with quantity, sometimes, it overshadows the quality. There are too many things to get your attention, which then makes it hard to determine whether what you ate really was special or not. 

I probably won't go to a buffet again for the next year, as this restaurant filled my buffet quota. Three stars, it was A-OK, but I'd rather go somewhere cheaper, and more special, and more intimate. While a buffet is a good way to sample what a restaurant offers, I'd go for quality over quantity any time."

Strongly recommended"
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,4,2014-03-28,"Wild choices of yummy food from south east asia.
With an open Wok grill, where you can choose your ingredients.

The fairly priced open buffet, is ""balanced"" with rather expensive drinks.....

The staff is super friendly, and the food quality is great....the location is in the middle of no where, and would make sense only if you have access to a car."
Royal Garden,Chinese,4.5,А11-20,3,2015-02-22,"Near where I live, but definitely not my favor. not original enough, more or less like german style chinese food; many people went there, buffet have a lot of Asian things. Stuff are nice."
